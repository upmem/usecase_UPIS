The '''French Open''' ({{lang-fr|Internationaux de France de Tennis}}), also called '''Roland-Garros''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁɔlɑ̃ ɡaʁos|lang}}), is a major [[tennis]] [[tournament]] held over two weeks at the [[Stade Roland Garros|Stade Roland-Garros]] in [[Paris]], France, beginning in late May each year.{{efn|Usually when the tournament is held in the May–June schedule, there are exceptions have been made: 1946 and 1947 tournaments were held in July after [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] followed the [[aftermath of World War II]]; and 2020, which was held in late September after the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].}} The venue is named after the French aviator [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]].

==History==
Officially named in French ''Internationaux de France de Tennis'' and ''Roland-Garros'' (the "French International of Tennis" and "Roland Garros" in English),<ref>{{cite web|title=Un siècle d'histoire|url=https://www.rolandgarros.com/fr-fr/page/roland-garros-un-siecle-histoire-de-decugis-a-nadal|website=rolandgarros.com}}</ref> the tournament is referred to in English as the "French Open" and alternatively as "Roland Garros", which is the designation used by the tournament itself in all languages.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Christopher Clarey|title=A Puzzler in Paris: French Open or Roland Garros?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/24/sports/tennis/a-puzzler-in-paris-french-open-or-roland-garros.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 May 2013}}</ref> (The [[Stade Roland-Garros|stadium]] and tournament are both hyphenated as ''Roland-Garros'' because French spelling rules dictate that in the name of a place or event named after a person, the elements of the name are joined together with a [[hyphen]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Le Ramat typographique|last=Ramat|first=Aurel|year=1994|publisher=Éditions Charles Corlet|isbn=2854804686|page=63}}</ref>)

In 1891 the '''''Championnat de France''''', which is commonly referred to in English as the '''French Championships''', began. They were only open to tennis players who were members of French clubs. The first winner was [[H. Briggs]], a British who resided in Paris and was a member of the Club Stade Français. In the final he defeated [[P. Baigneres]] in straight sets.<ref name=PastWinners>{{cite web|work=rolandgarros.com |title=Event Guide / History / Past Winners 1891-2008 |url=http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |accessdate=2009-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513071553/http://www.rolandgarros.com/en_FR/about/history/pastwinners.html |archivedate=May 13, 2012 }}</ref> The first women's singles tournament, with four entries, was held in 1897. The mixed doubles event was added in 1902 and the women's doubles in 1907. This "French club members only" tournament was played until 1924, using four different venues during that period:

* Societé de Sport de Île de Puteaux, in [[Puteaux]], [[Île-de-France]] (nex to the [[Seine|Seine river]]); played on the club's ten sand grounds laid out on a bed of rubble. 1891, 1893, 1894 (men's singles), 1895 (men's singles), 1897 (women's singles), 1902 (women's singles and mixed doubles), 1905 (women's singles and mixed doubles), 1907 (men's singles, women's singles, mixed doubles) editions.
* The Croix-Catelan of the [[Racing Club de France]] (club founded in 1882 which initially had two lawn-tennis courts with four more grass courts opened some years later, but due to the difficulty of maintenance, they were eventually transformed into clay courts) in the [[Bois de Boulogne]], [[Paris]]. Played on [[Grass court|grass]] (''pelouse'') and later on [[Clay court|clay]]. 1892, 1894 (men's doubles), 1895 (men's doubles), 1897 (women's singles), 1901 (men's doubles), 1903 (men's doubles and mixed doubles), 1904, 1907 (men's doubles), 1908, 1910-1914, 1920-1924 editions.
* [[Tennis Club de Paris]] (club founded in 1895 which initially had four indoor wood courts and five outdoor clay courts), at 71, Boulevard Exelmans in the [[16th arrondissement of Paris|Auteuil]] neighborhood, Paris. Initially had four indoor wood courts and five outdoor clay courts. 1896, 1897 (men's singles), 1898, 1899, 1900, 1901 (men's and women's singles), 1902 (men's singles), 1903 (men's singles and women's singles), 1905 (men's singles) and 1906 editions.
* Société Athlétique de la Villa Primrose in [[Bordeaux]], on clay. Only played in 1909. 

In the period of 1915-1919, no tournament was organized due to [[World War I]].

In 1925, the French Championships became open to all amateurs internationally and was designated a major championship by the ILTF. It was held at the [[Stade Français]] in [[Saint-Cloud]] (site of the previous World Hard Court Championships) in 1925 and 1927, on clay courts. In 1926 the Croix-Catelan of the Racing Club de France hosted the event in Paris, site of the previous French club members only tournament, also on clay.

Another clay court tournament, called the [[World Hard Court Championships]], is sometimes considered the true precursor to the modern French Open as it admitted international competitors. This was held at Stade Français in Saint-Cloud, from 1912 to 1914, 1920, 1921 and 1923, with the 1922 event held in [[Brussels]], Belgium. Winners of this tournament included world No. 1s such as Tony Wilding from New Zealand (1913, 1914) and Bill Tilden from the US (1921). In 1924 there was no World Hard Court Championships due to tennis being played at the Paris Olympic Games.

After the [[The Four Musketeers (tennis)|Mousquetaires]] or Philadelphia Four ([[René Lacoste]], [[Jean Borotra]], [[Henri Cochet]], and [[Jacques Brugnon]]) won the [[Davis Cup]] on American soil in 1927, the French decided to defend the cup in 1928 at a new tennis stadium at Porte d'Auteuil. The ''Stade de France'' had offered the tennis authorities three hectares of land with the condition that the new stadium must be named after the World War I hero [[aviator|pilot]] [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]].<ref>{{cite web |author1=Evan Gershkovich |title=Who was Roland Garros?

On May 24, 1928 the French International Championships moved there, and the event has been held there ever since.<ref name="Historypage">{{cite web | title=Roland Garros: a venue open all year long.

During World War II, the [[Tournoi de France (tennis)|tournament]] was not held in 1940 and from 1941 through 1945 it took place on the same grounds, but those events are not recognized by the French governing body, the [[Fédération Française de Tennis]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author1=Henry D.

Since 1981, new prizes have been presented: the Prix Orange (for the player demonstrating the best sportsmanship and cooperative attitude with the press), the Prix Citron (for the player with the strongest character and personality) and the Prix Bourgeon (for the tennis player revelation of the year). In another novelty, since 2006 the tournament has begun on a Sunday, featuring 12 singles matches played on the three main courts. Additionally, on the eve of the tournament's opening, the traditional Benny Berthet exhibition day takes place, where the profits go to different charity associations. In March 2007, it was announced that the event would provide equal prize money for both men and women in all rounds for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1215 |title=Roland Garros Awards Equal Pay |publisher=WTA Tour |date=16 March 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623122943/http://www.sonyericssonwtatour.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=1215 |archivedate=23 June 2007 }}</ref>
In 2010, it was announced that the French Open was considering a move away from Roland Garros as part of a continuing rejuvenation of the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8580652.stm| title=French Open could move away from Roland Garros in Paris| date=16 March 2007|accessdate=20 July 2007|work=BBC News}}</ref> Plans to renovate and expand Roland Garros have put aside any such consideration, and the tournament remains in its long time home.

===Expansion in the early 21st century===
From 2004 to 2008, plans were developed to build a covered stadium with a roof, as complaints continued over delayed matches.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/3781357.stm | title=Roland Garros set for roof | accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/27/sports/tennis/27tennis.ready.html | title=French Open Adds Day; Clay Stays the Same | accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french08/news/story?id=3413596 | title=Only 13 matches completed before rain halts play | accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref> Various proposals were put forward to expand the facility or to move the French Open to a completely new, 55-court venue outside of Paris city limits.

Renovation work finally commenced at the close of the 2018 edition of the tournament. Redeveloped seating and a retractable roof was constructed for Court Philippe-Chatrier and the new 5,000-seat Court [[Simonne Mathieu|Simonne-Mathieu]] was opened, having been named after France's second-highest achieving female tennis player, and noted for its innovative use of greenhouse encasing architecture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/french-open-2019-day-one-court-simonnemathieu-roland-garros-paris-new-court-a8931081.html|title=Court Simonne-Mathieu stunning new addition to Roland Garros|date=2019-05-26|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> The renewal of the venue has been generally well-received by the players and the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.francetvinfo.fr/sports/tennis/roland-garros/un-ecrin-extraordinaire-le-court-simonne-mathieu-de-roland-garros-fait-l-unanimite-chez-les-joueurs-et-spectateurs_3470487.html|title="Un écrin extraordinaire" : le court Simonne-Mathieu de Roland-Garros fait l'unanimité chez les joueurs et spectateurs|date=2019-06-02|website=Franceinfo|language=fr|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> The 2020 edition of the tournament, which was the first to be assisted by the roof over Philippe-Chatrier, was postponed to September and was played before limited spectators, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/sports/tennis/french-open-preview.html|title=New for This Pandemic French Open: Fall Weather and Lights|work=The New York Times|date=27 September 2020|author=Christopher Clarey}}</ref> Floodlights were also installed over each of the courts in the precinct, allowing the tournament to facilitate night matches for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tennishead.net/french-open-lights-up-as-another-tradition-dies/|title=French Open lights up as another tradition dies|date=21 September 2020|work=tennishead.net}}</ref>

==Surface characteristics==

Clay courts slow down the ball and produce a high bounce when compared with [[grass court]]s or [[Hard (tennis)|hard courts]]. For this reason, clay courts take away some of the advantages of big servers and serve-and-volleyers, which makes it hard for these types of players to dominate on the surface. For example, [[Pete Sampras]], known for his huge serve and who won 14 Grand Slam titles, never won the French Open – his best result was reaching the semi-finals in [[1996 French Open|1996]]. Many other notable players have won multiple Grand Slam events but have never won the French Open, including [[John McEnroe]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[John Newcombe]], [[Venus Williams]], [[Stefan Edberg]], [[Boris Becker]], Lleyton Hewitt, [[Jimmy Connors]], [[Louise Brough]], [[Virginia Wade]] or [[Martina Hingis]]; McEnroe and Edberg lost their sole French Open finals appearances in five sets.

On the other hand, players whose games are more suited to slower surfaces, such as [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Björn Borg]], [[Ivan Lendl]], [[Mats Wilander]], [[Justine Henin]] and [[Chris Evert]], have found great success at this tournament.  In the [[Tennis open era|Open Era]], the only male players who have won both the French Open and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], played on faster grass courts, are [[Rod Laver]], [[Jan Kodeš]], [[Björn Borg]], [[Andre Agassi]], [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Novak Djokovic]] and [[Roger Federer]]. Borg's French Open—Wimbledon double was achieved three times consecutively (1978, 1979, 1980) and regarded by Wimbledon officials as "the most difficult double in tennis".<ref name=Wimbledonrecords>{{cite web |url=http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/legends/bjorn-borg |title=Wimbledon Legends – Bjorn Borg |publisher=Wimbledon.com |first=Ronald |last=Atkin |accessdate=4 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211101251/http://www.wimbledon.com/heritage/history/legends/bjorn-borg |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The feat took 28 years to be repeated and was done 3 times consecutively, twice by Rafael Nadal (2008, 2010) and once by Roger Federer (2009).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2014/06/nadal-roland-garros-wimbledon-double-no-longer-tough/51865/|title=Nadal: Roland Garros-Wimbledon double no longer that tough|website=Tennis.com|access-date=2019-01-30}}</ref>

==Ball boys and ball girls==
At the 2010 French Open there were 250 "ramasseurs de balles" which in English translates literally as "gatherers of balls".  They are aged between 12 and 16 years old, and dress in matching shirts and shorts. The 250 ball boys and ball girls are chosen to take part in the French Open by an application and selection process, which in 2010 had approximately 2,500 applicants from across France.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/sports/tennis/02ballkids.html| title=Ball Kids Wake Up The French Open| date=1 June 2010|accessdate=20 April 2011|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Branch}}</ref> Upon selection the ball boys and ball girls participate in preparatory training in the weeks leading up to the French Open to ensure that they are prepared for the day they set foot on the tennis court in front of a global audience.

==Prize money and ranking points==

Other than a three-year stint on [[Tennis on CBS|CBS]], NBC has remained the American [[television network]] home of the French Open since [[1983 French Open|1983]]. Since acquiring rights to the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 2019, NBC's coverage begins on [[Memorial Day]], the second day of the tournament; the network provides coverage windows on the holiday and the second weekend in the afternoon U.S. time. These windows consist of exclusive tape-delayed matches from earlier in the day, but any ongoing matches at the window's start are shown live to their conclusion. The later men's and women's semifinals are broadcast live on NBC in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and tape-delayed in others, but since 2017 these matches are also simulcast on [[NBCSN]] to allow nationwide live coverage. Finals are live nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=French Open TV Schedule 2018 |url=http://www.sportsmediawatch.com/french-open-tv-schedule-nbc-tennis-channel-nbcsn-not-espn/ |website=Sports Media Watch |date=19 May 2016}}</ref>
