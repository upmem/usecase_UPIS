'''Freedom Ship''' was a [[ocean colonization|floating city]] project initially proposed in the late 1990s.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1999/07/05/MN33508.DTL&type=printable Robert Trigaux, "Water World", sfgate.com, from ''St. Petersburg Times'', 5 July 1999.]</ref> It was so named because of the "free" international lifestyle facilitated by a mobile ocean colony, though the project would not be a conventional ship, but rather a series of linked [[barge]]s.

The Freedom Ship project envisioned a {{convert|1800|m}}-long integrated city<ref name="science.howstuffworks.com">[http://science.howstuffworks.com/floating-city1.htm Floating Cities] at [[How Stuff Works]]; a discussion of [[Very large floating structure|floating cities]] using Freedom Ship as its example</ref> with [[condominium]] housing for 80,000 people,<ref name="science.howstuffworks.com" /> a hospital, school system, hotel, casino, commercial and office 
occupancies, [[duty-free shop]]ping and other facilities, large enough to require [[rapid transit]]. The complex would have [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe continuously, stopping regularly at [[Port#Port of call|ports of call]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news

==Construction==
Freedom Ship International initially estimated the net cost for construction to be US$6 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] in 1999. However, by 2002, estimates had risen to US$11 billion.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> A July 2008 press release explained the difficulty of obtaining reliable financial backing. In November 2013, the company announced that the project, now with an estimated price of US$10 billion, was being resurrected, though that construction had not yet begun. In 2016, the project affiliated with Kanethara Marine in India.<ref>http://www.freedomcruiseline.com/news.php</ref>

The basic idea had been published by [[Jules Verne]] in his novel ''[[Propeller Island]]''. No technical details were given, but the book includes the idea of building a gigantic raft. The main aim of the project was saving taxes, as the Island would move around the world on an annual basis.

Other projects, such as the [[ResidenSea]], have similarly attempted to create mobile communities, though they have conservatively limited themselves to the constraints of conventional shipbuilding.  In regards to the economic flexibility and "freedom" created by such mobile settlements, these projects could be considered a realization of the avant-garde [[Ron_Herron#Walking_City|Walking City]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/archigrams-walking-city-60s-architectural-vision-future/8368 |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214094455/http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/archigrams-walking-city-60s-architectural-vision-future/8368 |archive-date=14 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> concept from 1964, by British architect [[Ron Herron]] of the group [[Archigram]]. The Freedom Ship also served as the inspiration for (and is closely resembled by) the ''Libertania'', a mobile ship depicted in Grant Morrison's comic book ''[[The Filth (comics)|The Filth]]''. In the 1950s, [[Buckminster Fuller]] also proposed "floating cities" approximately a mile wide that could accommodate up to 50,000 permanent inhabitants.  Mike Wallace interviewed Buckminster Fuller on TV regarding this "floating cities" concept, which Fuller explained would free up land needed for agriculture and industrial uses.
