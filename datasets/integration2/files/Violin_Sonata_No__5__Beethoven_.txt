The '''Violin Sonata No. 5''' in [[F major]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 24, is a [[violin sonata]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. It is often known as the "Spring Sonata" (''Frühlingssonate''), and was published in [[1801 in music|1801]]. It was dedicated to [[Count Moritz von Fries]], a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the [[String Quintet, Op. 29 (Beethoven)|String Quintet in C major, Op. 29]] and the [[Violin Sonata No. 4 (Beethoven)|Violin Sonata No. 4]]—as well as his later [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Oeuvres/ListOpus.html|title=Beethoven's music with Opus number|website=Ludwig van Beethoven's website|accessdate=2014-10-18}}</ref>

==Origin==

Beethoven initially intended to pair this piece with his [[Violin_Sonata_No._4_(Beethoven)|Violin Sonata No. 4]], Opus 23. As [[Joseph Szigeti]] noted, the two pieces complement each other in both key and character.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Szigeti |first1=Joseph |title=The Ten Beethoven Sonatas for Piano and Violin |date=1965 |publisher=Urbana, Ill. : American String Teachers Association, ©1965 |page=14 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/399883 |accessdate=17 June 2020}}</ref> This piece has a more lyrical quality while its intended pairing has a grabbing and agitated touch.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lockwood |first1=Lewis |title=The Beethoven Violin Sonatas: History, Criticism, Performance |date=July 8, 2004 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=0252029321 |page=24 |url=https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9780252029325-item.html?s_campaign=Google_BookSearch_organichttps://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9780252029325-item.html?s_campaign=Google_BookSearch_organic |accessdate=17 June 2020}}</ref> However, the two were never published together and thus have different opus numbers. The reason for such a separation is unknown.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nettle |first1=Paul |title=Beethoven Encyclopedia |date=May 20, 2007 |publisher=Philosophical Library |isbn=0806529970 |pages=295-296 |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Beethoven-Encyclopedia-Paul-Nettl/dp/0806529970 |accessdate=17 June 2020}}</ref>

==Structure==

The work is in four movements:

#''Allegro''
#''Adagio molto espressivo''
#''[[Scherzo]]: Allegro molto''
#''[[Rondo]]: Allegro ma non troppo''

The ''Scherzo'' and its trio are particularly brief; the entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name "Spring Sonata" was given to it after Beethoven's death.{{cn|date=July 2020}}

The ''Allegro'' movement is featured in the stage show ''[[Fame (musical)|Fame]]'' and in the grade 8 syllabus of [[ABRSM]]'s bowed strings exam from 2016–2019.{{cn|date=August 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.abrsm.org/media/62976/violincomplete16.pdf|title=ABRSM Bowed Strings Syllabus 2016–2019|last=|first=|date=2016|website=ABRSM|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>

While reviewing the [[Classic Produktion Osnabrück|cpo]] recording of composer [[Ferdinand Ries]]'s violin sonatas Op. 8 No. 1, Op. 16 No. 2 and Op. 71, Jonathan Woolf commented that the Op. 8 No. 1 sonata was heavily inspired by this work.<ref>{{harvnb|Woolf|2016}}</ref>
