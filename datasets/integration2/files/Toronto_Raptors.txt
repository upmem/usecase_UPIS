The '''Toronto Raptors''' are<!-- Canadian English (individual teams agree with the plural form) --> a Canadian professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Toronto]]<!-- Please don't add Ontario and/or Canada, since it is redundant -->. The Raptors compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member of the league's [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] [[Atlantic Division (NBA)|Atlantic Division]]. They normally play their home games at [[Scotiabank Arena]], which they share with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), but they will use [[Amalie Arena]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] as its home for the [[2020–21 NBA season|2020–21 season]]. The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's [[Expansion of the National Basketball Association|expansion]] into Canada, along with the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]. Since the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]], the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies [[Vancouver Grizzlies relocation to Memphis|relocated]] from [[Vancouver]] to [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

As with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of [[Vince Carter]] through a [[1998 NBA draft|draft-day trade in 1998]], the franchise set league-attendance records and made the [[NBA playoffs]] in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]], [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Playoffs|2002]]. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the [[2002–03 Toronto Raptors season|2002–03]] and [[2003–04 Toronto Raptors season|2003–04 seasons]], they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the [[Brooklyn Nets|New Jersey Nets]].

After Carter left, [[Chris Bosh]] emerged as the team leader. For the [[2006–07 Toronto Raptors season|2006–07 season]], [[Bryan Colangelo]] was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their [[2007 NBA Playoffs|first playoff berth in five years]], capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the [[2007–08 Toronto Raptors season|2007–08 season]], they also advanced to the [[2008 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the [[2009–10 Toronto Raptors season|2009–10 season]] in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the [[Miami Heat]] in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.

[[Masai Ujiri]] replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of [[DeMar DeRozan]] and [[Kyle Lowry]]. The Raptors returned to the [[2014 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in [[2017–18 Toronto Raptors season|2018]]. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach [[Dwane Casey]] after the [[2018 NBA playoffs|2018 playoffs]] concluded and conduct the high-profile trade of DeRozan for [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Danny Green (basketball)|Danny Green]] later that summer, as well as acquiring [[Marc Gasol]] before the [[Trade (sports)#NBA 2|trade deadline]]. In the [[2019 NBA playoffs|2019 playoffs]], the Raptors won their first [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference]] title and advanced to their first [[2019 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]], where they won their first NBA championship.

==Franchise history==
===Background===
On November 1, 1946, the [[Toronto Huskies]] hosted the [[New York Knickerbockers]] at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the [[Basketball Association of America]]).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Drolet |first1=Mike |title=How Canada helped kick-start the NBA |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/5333595/first-nba-game-ever-canada/ |accessdate=August 6, 2020 |agency=[[Global News]] |date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> However, the Huskies folded after the initial [[1946–47 BAA season|1946–47 season]]. Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the [[Buffalo Braves]] played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brady |first1=Erik |title=With NBA Finals in Toronto, recalling the man who once shunned the Braves |url=https://buffalonews.com/opinion/columnists/with-nba-finals-in-toronto-recalling-the-man-who-once-shunned-the-braves/article_465e0c05-b009-5c2c-bc11-86143fbec30b.html |accessdate=August 6, 2020 |agency=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=May 28, 2019}}</ref>

Interest to move or expand an NBA franchise to Toronto grew during the 1980s. Although the logistics and costs associated with basing a team in Canada were often thought of as deterrents for Canadian expansion by American-based sports leagues; the size of Toronto's media market made its potential difficult to ignore. The NBA organized two exhibition games in 1989 and 1992 with an attendance of over 25,000 people each, both in the newly built [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]].<ref name="groundwork"/>

On April 23, 1993, Professional Basketball Franchise (Canada) Inc. (PBF) formally submitted an application for a Toronto-based team, one of three groups seeking the rights to the franchise. Also in the running were [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment|Maple Leaf Garden Ltd.]], predecessor to MLSE and the owners of Maple Leaf Gardens. Later that year, in July, the NBA Expansion Committee visited various existing and proposed stadium sites along with the bid contenders. On September 30, 1993, the committee recommended conditionally awarding PBF the franchise.<ref name="groundwork"/>

===Creation===
The team was formalized on November 4, 1993, when the NBA Board of Governors endorsed the decision of Expansion Committee and awarded its 28th [[Professional sports league organization|franchise]] to a group headed by Toronto businessman [[John Bitove]] for a then-record expansion fee of [[United States dollar|US$]]125 million.<ref name="groundwork" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/the-nba-is-coming-to-toronto|title=The NBA is coming to Toronto|date=November 14, 1993|accessdate=March 19, 2017|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> Bitove and [[Allan Slaight]] of [[Slaight Communications]] each owned 44 per cent, with the [[Scotiabank|Bank of Nova Scotia]] (10 per cent), [[David Peterson]] (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.<ref name="groundwork" /><ref name=arenawars>{{cite news|title=Arena wars [The Raptors and the Leafs needed new arenas and it would have been smart to share]|last=Tedesco|first=Theresa|date=December 1997|newspaper=[[Toronto Life]]}}</ref> [[Sports betting|Wagering on NBA games]] in [[Ontario]] nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the [[Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation]] (OLG), which is the provincial lottery corporation that regulates gambling in Ontario, agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate OLG for its loss of revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/basketball/2010/01/26/12623001.html|title=OLG 'hopeful' of adding NBA to Pro-Line|first=Mike|last=Ganter|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/proline-raptors-wagering/|title=Pro-Line brings back wagering on all NBA games|date=January 26, 2010|accessdate=June 16, 2015|publisher=[[Sportsnet]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2010/01/27/negotiations_to_add_nba_to_proline_tickets_in_ontario.html|title=Negotiations to add NBA to Pro-Line tickets in Ontario|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=June 16, 2015|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref> The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game in 1995.

====Naming the team ====
Initial sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Donovan |first=Michael Leo |date=1997 |title=The Name Game: Football, Baseball, Hockey & Basketball How Your Favorite Sports Teams Were Named |publisher=Warwick Publishing |location=Toronto |isbn=1-895629-74-8 }}</ref> As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to eleven prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, Terriers and Towers (the eventual runner-up).<ref name="groundwork" /> The final selection—''Toronto Raptors''—was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994:<ref name="groundwork" /> the choice was influenced by the popularity of the [[Jurassic Park (film)|1993 film adaption]] of the 1990 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]]. The name "Raptor" is a common informal name for the ''[[Velociraptor]]'', a swift medium-sized [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] [[Theropoda|theropod]] non-avian [[dinosaur]]. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first general manager, [[Isiah Thomas]], were revealed at a press conference.<ref name="groundwork" /> As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.<ref>{{cite news|title='Piston for life' Thomas named Raptors' GM NBA superstar to have 10% stake in new franchise|date=May 25, 1994|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|last=Young|first=Chris}}</ref><ref name=double/>  He would purchase 4.5 per cent in May 1995<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' Thomas 'voice of reason' in NBA talks|date=August 13, 1995|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|last=Young|first=Chris}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Thomas is key player on Raptors' court He handles everything but the ball for new basketball squad|date=October 19, 1995|first=David|last=Israelson|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref> and a further 4.5 per cent in December 1995,<ref name=double>{{cite news|title=Thomas to double stake in Raptors Price undisclosed, but thought to be bargain for Toronto GM|date=December 29, 1995|last=Campbell|first=Neil|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Thomas to up stake in Raptors|date=December 28, 1995|newspaper=[[Vancouver Sun|The Vancouver Sun]]}}</ref> half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5 per cent.<ref name=groundwork/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1996/10/21/Franchises/RAPTORS-UP-FOR-GRABS-AS-SLAIGHT-ENACTS-BUYOUT-CLAUSE.aspx|title=RAPTORS UP FOR GRABS AS SLAIGHT ENACTS BUYOUT CLAUSE|date=October 21, 1996|accessdate=December 27, 2013}}</ref> The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; "Naismith" silver was chosen to honour Canadian [[James Naismith]], the inventor of basketball.<ref name="groundwork" /> The team originally competed in the [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]],<ref name="9596stand">{{cite web|title=1995–96 Standings|url=http://www.nba.com/history/standings/19951996.html|website=NBA.com/History|access-date=June 16, 2007}}</ref> and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.<ref name="groundwork" />

As general manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time [[Detroit Pistons]] assistant [[Brendan Malone]] as the Raptors' head coach.<ref name="groundwork" /> The team's roster was then filled as a result of an [[1995 NBA expansion draft|expansion draft in 1995]]. Following a [[coin flipping|coin flip]], Toronto was given first choice and selected [[Chicago Bulls]] [[point guard]] and [[Three-point field goal|three-point]] specialist [[B. J. Armstrong]]. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the [[Golden State Warriors]] for [[power forward (basketball)|power forwards]] [[Carlos Rogers (basketball)|Carlos Rogers]] and [[Victor Alexander]].<ref name="groundwork" /> Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans [[Jerome Kersey]], [[Willie Anderson (basketball)|Willie Anderson]] and his former Pistons teammate [[John Salley]].<ref name="groundwork" />

Subsequent to the expansion draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the [[NBA draft lottery]], behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected [[Damon Stoudamire]],<!-- prior to 2010, the player written off is [[Damon Stoudamire]]; the player written off in 2010 is [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] — notice the "a" vs the "e" following "Stoud" --> a point guard out of [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]], around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. However, the selection of Stoudamire was met with [[Booing|boos]] from fans at the [[1995 NBA draft]] at the SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted [[Ed O'Bannon]] of [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]], an [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Final Four]] [[Most valuable player|Most Valuable Player]].<ref name="groundwork" />

[[File:RogersCentre Toronto Sept1-05.jpg|thumb|SkyDome, known as [[Rogers Centre]] since 2005, was the original venue for Raptors home games from 1995 to 1999]]

</ref> To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald traded Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for [[Charles Oakley]],<ref name="rap9899">[http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/199899.html 1998–99: Raptors' Best Season Ever], nba.com/raptors, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> a veteran with [[NBA playoffs|playoff]] experience. [[Kevin Willis]], another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and [[Doug Christie]] to play point guard. Both Christie and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed into one of the elite defenders in the NBA,<ref name="rap9899" /> while Williams improved his play on the offensive end. New coach [[Butch Carter]] was also credited with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout-shortened [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99 season]]. Although the team did not make the [[1999 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], many were optimistic with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter<ref name="vincebio" /> and a much improved McGrady.

[[File:Air Canada Centre and CN Tower from Bay St.jpg|thumb|The Raptors moved to Scotiabank Arena (then known as Air Canada Centre) in 1999]]
During the [[1999 NBA draft]], believing that the Raptors still lacked a strong [[frontcourt]] presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick [[Jonathan Bender]] for power forward [[Antonio Davis]] of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors starting lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would be out of the league by age 29.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/antonio_davis/ Antonio Davis Bio], nba.com, accessed April 8, 2008.</ref> In the backcourt, Carter, Christie and [[Dell Curry]] played at the [[shooting guard]] position and Alvin Williams and [[Muggsy Bogues]] at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever [[2000 NBA Playoffs|playoff]] appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season.<ref name="rap9900">[http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/199900.html 1999-00: Future Looks Bright for Raptors], nba.com/raptors, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round.<ref name="rap9900" /> Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA [[Slam Dunk Contest]]<ref name="vincebio" />—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to [[baseball]] and [[Canadian football]].<ref name="rap9900" /> Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/standings/19992000.html 1999–2000 Standings], nba.com/history, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref>

Still, playoff failures and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior to the [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01 season]] with [[Lenny Wilkens]], a [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/players/wilkens_bio.html Lenny Wilkens Bio], nba.com/history, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker [[Mark Jackson]] on a four-year contract.<ref name="rap0001">[http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/200001.html 2000–01: Raptors Taste Playoff Success], nba.com/raptors, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref> When Alvin Williams later emerged as a clutch performer,<ref>[http://www.raptorshq.com/2009/4/11/1115742/tip-in-toronto-raptors-post-game Not Just Any Williams], raptorshq.com, accessed May 9, 2011.</ref> Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time.<ref name="rap0001" /> In the 2000 off-season, free agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando Magic for a first-round draft pick.<ref>

[[File:Lipofsky Vince Carter.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vince Carter]], drafted fifth in the [[1998 NBA draft]], played his first six seasons in the NBA with the Raptors]]
As predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the [[2001 NBA playoffs]] with a franchise-high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the [[2001 NBA Playoffs#.281.29 Philadelphia 76ers vs. .285.29 Toronto Raptors|Eastern Conference Semifinals]] for the first time in franchise history.<ref name="rap0001" /><ref>[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2001/quarter/east4/?nav=SiteFragment NBA Playoffs 2001], nba.com, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard [[Allan Houston]] and Carter defend small forward [[Latrell Sprewell]], the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with [[Philadelphia 76ers]] was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Dikembe Mutombo]] for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from [[Aaron McKie]]. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and [[Chris Childs (basketball)|Chris Childs]] and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.<ref>Associated Press.

Despite Toronto's improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to [[Ben Wallace]]'s strong performance of 19 points, 20 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 3 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] and 3 [[steal (basketball)|steals]].<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/scores102/102111/102111320.htm Raptors vs. Pistons], usatoday.com, April 21, 2002, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref> Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit.<ref name="rap0102" /> With 10.7 seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play,<ref name="recap20020502">[http://www.nba.com/games/20020502/TORDET/recap.html Raptors vs. Pistons], nba.com, May 2, 2002, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/hakeem_olajuwon/index.html Hakeem Olajuwon Info Page], nba.com, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref> Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.

The [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03 season]] began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the [[2003 NBA All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]],<ref name="vincebio" /> suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto and Wilkens' ''laissez-faire'' attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury.<ref name="raps0203">[http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/200203.html 2002–03: Injuries Halt High Hopes], nba.com/raptors, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season.<ref name="raps0203" /> Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook [[Bill Fitch]] for the most losses by an NBA coach,<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2003/04/01/pistons-raptors030401.html "Raptors' Wilkens ties futility record"], cbc.ca, April 2, 2003, accessed April 21, 2007.</ref> with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total.

This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the 4th overall pick in the [[2003 NBA draft]] and brought another star to Toronto in [[Chris Bosh]].

After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the [[2004 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]], but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games.<ref name="raps0304" /> The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 [[points per game|ppg]], Marshall's 10.7 [[Rebound (sports)|rpg]], and rookie Bosh, a 6–10 forward-centre, averaging 11.5&nbsp;ppg and 7.4&nbsp;rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.<ref name="boshbio">

For the [[2004–05 NBA season|2004–05 season]], the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team.

After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent.

===2006–2010: Chris Bosh era===
The [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07 season]] represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of [[2006 NBA draft]] number one pick [[Andrea Bargnani]], the acquisition of point guard [[T. J. Ford]] in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard [[Anthony Parker]] and small forward [[Jorge Garbajosa]].<ref name="signs">[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/CP_bosh_071406.html "Raptors re-sign star forward Chris Bosh to contract extension"], nba.com, July 14, 2006, accessed May 9, 2011.</ref> Bosh was given a three-year contract extension,<ref name="signs" /> while [[Maurizio Gherardini]] of [[Pallacanestro Treviso|Benetton Treviso]] was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/pressrelease_062206.html "Raptors Name Gherardini To Basketball Staff"], nba.com/raptors, June 22, 2006, accessed June 17, 2007.</ref>

On April 24, 2007, the Raptors won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 victory over the New Jersey Nets,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/postup_042407.html Raptors Post Up], nba.com/raptors, April 24, 2007, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> but lost the series 4–2.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/postup_050407.html Raptors Post Up], nba.com/raptors, May 4, 2007, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to [[New Jersey]], the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey chipped away and had a chance to win the game, but [[Boštjan Nachbar]]'s three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but [[Richard Jefferson]] hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.

Several changes to the roster were made before the [[2007–08 NBA season|2007–08]] campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired [[Carlos Delfino]] in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/release_061507.html Raptors Acquire Carlos Delfino From Pistons], nba.com/raptors, June 15, 2007, accessed July 22, 2007.</ref> and signed [[Jamario Moon]]<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/moonpr_071007.html Raptors Sign Jamario Moon], nba.com/raptors, July 10, 2007, accessed July 22, 2007.</ref> and three-point specialist [[Jason Kapono]] as free agents.<ref>Ulmer, Mike, [http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/kaponoulmer_071207.html "Kapono Happy to be Joining Raptors"], nba.com/raptors, July 12, 2007, accessed July 13, 2007.</ref> On the other hand, veteran [[swingman]] Morris Peterson joined the [[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/story/2007/07/23/nba-hornets-peterson.html?ref=rss Hornets ink Morris Peterson for 4 years], cbc.ca, July 23, 2007, accessed August 9, 2007.</ref> Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.<ref>Feschuk, Dave, [https://www.thestar.com/Sports/NBA/article/272155 "Raptors will defend crown"], thestar.com, October 31, 2007, accessed November 1, 2007.</ref> However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign.

The Raptors finished 41-41, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the 6th seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent [[Orlando Magic]]. In Game 1, [[Dwight Howard]] gave the Magic their first playoff win since [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003]] as they practically led the entire game.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/games/20080420/TORORL/recap.html Dwight Howard's 20–20 Game Leads Magic Past Raptors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102234046/http://www.nba.com/games/20080420/TORORL/recap.html |date=November 2, 2012 }}, NBA.com</ref> Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as [[Hedo Türkoğlu]] scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, [[Jameer Nelson]], [[Rashard Lewis]] and [[Keith Bogans]] keyed strong three point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.<ref>[https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2008.html 2007–08 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref><ref name="rev78">Ulmer, Mike, [http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/ulmerendofseason_043008.html "Raptors Head Home For The Summer"], nba.com/raptors, April 30, 2008, accessed May 4, 2008.</ref> Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, and a lack of a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.<ref name="rev78" />

As it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the [[2008–09 NBA season|2008–09 campaign]]: six-time All-Star [[Jermaine O'Neal]] was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calderón), [[Rasho Nesterović]], [[Maceo Baston]], and [[Roy Hibbert]], the 17th pick in the [[2008 NBA draft]], giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt.<ref>Smith, Doug, [https://www.thestar.com/Sports/NBA/article/449548 "Blockbuster deal for Raptors"], thestar.com, June 26, 2008, accessed June 27, 2008.</ref> Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a [[maple leaf]] featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as "Canada's team".<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/506400 Raptors unveil new alternate road uniforms], thestar.com, September 25, 2008, accessed October 14, 2008.</ref> Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant [[Jay Triano]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/mitchell_120308.html Mitchell Relieved Of Duties, Jay Triano Takes Over On Interim Basis], nba.com/raptors, December 3, 2008, accessed December 3, 2008.</ref> Triano tweaked the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior to the All-Star break.

Bosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami.<ref>Smith, Doug, [https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/nba/raptors/chrisbosh/article/834440--raptors-acquire-two-first-round-picks-trade-exception-for-bosh "Raptors acquire two first-round picks, trade exception for Bosh"], thestar.com, July 10, 2010, accessed July 10, 2010.</ref> Prior to this, Toronto had [[2010 NBA draft|drafted]] [[Ed Davis (basketball)|Ed Davis]], also a left-handed power forward like Bosh.

[[Dwane Casey]], an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the [[2011–12 NBA season|2011–12 season]].<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/raptors-hire-casey-as-head-coach/article2068753/ Raptors hire Casey as head coach], globeandmail.com, June 21, 2011, accessed July 1, 2011.</ref> The Raptors used their number five pick to select [[Jonas Valančiūnas]], a centre from Lithuania in the [[2011 NBA draft]]. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the [[2011 NBA lockout]], and the Raptors finished the season with a 23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP [[Steve Nash]], who had become a free agent after playing for the [[Phoenix Suns]], to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard [[Kyle Lowry]] from the Houston Rockets for a future first round pick. Lowry, combined with Valančiūnas and the 8th pick in the [[2012 NBA draft|2012 draft]] [[Terrence Ross]], represented the next phase of the re-building process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star [[Rudy Gay]] and centre [[Hamed Haddadi]] as well as Pistons player [[Austin Daye]] in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran [[Tayshaun Prince]] and a second round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard [[Sebastian Telfair]]. The [[2012–13 NBA season|2012–13 season]] was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall losing record (34–48).

During the 2013 off-season, new general manager [[Masai Ujiri]] traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby, [[Steve Novak]], [[Quentin Richardson]], a future first-round draft pick, and two future second-round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after the trade. The Raptors also added [[Tyler Hansbrough]], [[D. J. Augustin]], [[Dwight Buycks]], and Austin Daye via free agency. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors traded Rudy Gay, [[Quincy Acy]], and [[Aaron Gray]] to the [[Sacramento Kings]] for [[John Salmons]], [[Greivis Vásquez]], [[Patrick Patterson (basketball)|Patrick Patterson]], and [[Chuck Hayes]], and waived Augustin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.raptors.com/press-releases/raptors-kings-120913/|title=Raptors Acquire Vasquez, Salmons, Hayes & Patterson From Kings|work=NBA.com|date=December 9, 2013|access-date=December 9, 2013}}</ref>

During the [[2013–14 NBA season|2013–14 season]], the Raptors were 6–12 before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade they went on a 10–3 run, as they maintained their lead in the division and rose above the .500 mark for the first time in almost three years. The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so.

The fear that Leonard would depart after only one season materialised when he signed for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. Nonetheless, the Raptors managed to win 53 games in [[2019–20 NBA season|a season]] shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic to secure the second seed. Their winning percentage (73.6%) was the best in franchise history, and the season also saw the elevation of [[Pascal Siakam]] to an All-Star and Nurse being named as Coach of the Year. In the [[2020 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]—which began later than usual in August, at the [[2020 NBA Bubble|"Bubble"]]—the Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4–0 in the first round. They went down 0–2 against the Boston Celtics in the next round, before [[OG Anunoby]] scored a buzzer-beater to win Toronto the third game. The series eventually went to seven games, with Boston prevailing.

Due to the Canadian government not allowing the Raptors to play games in Toronto because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the Raptors will play their home games for the [[2020–21 NBA season|2020–21 NBA Season]] at [[Amalie Arena]] in [[Tampa, Florida]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-20|title=Raptors to call Tampa home to open NBA season|url=https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30354415/toronto-raptors-play-home-games-tampa-open-nba-season|access-date=2020-11-20|website=ESPN.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Logos and uniforms==

===Logos===
[[File:Toronto Raptors wordmark 2015-current.png|thumb|upright=0.68|Wordmark logo for the Raptors (2015–present)]]
Fueled by the success of the ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' film and the popularity of dinosaurs with younger audiences, who would grow up to be fans of the franchise, the team's first logo originally featured an aggressive-looking, red ''Velociraptor'' wearing white sneakers with exposed toe claws dribbling a basketball. The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and "Naismith silver" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, [[James Naismith]]). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.<ref name="groundwork"/> For the 2008−09 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.

On December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as "a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor".<ref name="NewRaptorsLogo">{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Primary Logo|url=https://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/logo_121914|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=December 19, 2014|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>

====Court art====
The Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in [[2017–18 Toronto Raptors season|early 2018]], in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary [[Tangerine Bank]]'s name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly [[ING Direct]]<!--Do not bypass redirect per [[WP:NOTBROKEN]]--> Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).

===Uniforms===
====Uniform evolution====
The uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995–96 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive ''Velociraptor'' dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999−2000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From the 2008−09 season through the 2014−15 season, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.

====2015 redesign====
On August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with [[2K Sports]]' ''[[NBA 2K16]]'' video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on [[National colours of Canada|Canada's national colours of red and white]], whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of "We The North". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's "We The North" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jersey. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter "T" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's [[Name of Toronto#Nicknames|"T-Dot" nickname]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Unveil New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/uniforms-080315|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 3, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}</ref>

====2017 onward====
In 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was allotted four primary uniforms, classified as “editions".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Nike and the NBA Reveal the First of the League's 2017-18 Game Uniforms|url=https://news.nike.com/news/nike-nba-game-uniforms|publisher=Nike|website=nike.com|date=June 18, 2017}}</ref> The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called "Association edition") and road (now the "Icon edition") uniforms, as well as their alternate ("Statement edition") uniforms. In addition, each franchise was also given new "City edition" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. For the 2018–19 season, the Raptors were one of the franchises awarded "Earned edition" uniforms, by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs.

====Jersey sponsors====
In the 2017 off-season, the Raptors announced that Toronto-based [[Sun Life Financial]] is the jersey sponsor for the Raptors starting in the 2017–18 season.<ref name="RaptorsSunLife" />

====Throwback and other jerseys====
On December 8, 2009, the Raptors introduced a blue-and-white [[Throwback uniform|throwback jersey]] to commemorate the [[Toronto Huskies]] of the Basketball Association of America, regarded by many as the unofficial, geographical predecessor of the Raptors.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors Announce Hardwood Classics Schedule and Unveil Huskies Uniform|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/raptors_huskies_release_120709.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=December 7, 2009|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref> The uniforms were the same as those worn by the Huskies during the [[1946–47 Toronto Huskies season|1946–47 season]], with the  exception of the nickname and length of the shorts. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009–10 season and have since been used as "retro" jerseys, worn during special "Huskies Nights".

In the [[2016–17 NBA season]], the Raptors not only unveiled the season's "retro" uniforms in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies, but also revealed a Huskies-themed throwback court.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Raptors unveil their incredible Toronto Huskies throwback court|url=https://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/11/12/13608974/raptors-unveil-huskies-court-toronto-nba|publisher=sbnation.com|date=November 12, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref> The franchise also launched a special red [[Chinese New Year]] jersey in celebration of the event. The Chinese New Year jersey features a stylized rendering of "Toronto" in white [[traditional Chinese characters]] ([[:wikt:多倫多|多倫多]], [[Pinyin]]: ''Duōlúnduō'') with the head of a leftward-facing (viewer's perspective) [[Chinese dragon]] replacing the upper half of the first [[:wikt:多|多 character]] and the Raptors slashed basketball logo replacing much of the bottom half of the [[:wikt:倫|倫 character]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Toronto Huskies & Chinese New Year Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/1617-uniforms/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|date=August 23, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>

Other jerseys worn by the Raptors include a green uniform worn from the [[2007–08 Toronto Raptors season|2007−08 season]] through to the [[2011–12 Toronto Raptors season|2011−12 season]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day|St. Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bojarinov|first1=Peter|title=Raptors News: Toronto Unveils St. Patrick's Day Jerseys|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/13474-raptors-news-toronto-unveils-st-patricks-day-jerseys|website=bleacherreport.com/|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=March 17, 2008}}</ref>

The Raptors also wear a camouflage uniform based on the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] variant of [[CADPAT]] (Canadian Disruptive Pattern) during special events involving the [[Canadian Armed Forces]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Raptors Host Annual Canadian Armed Forces Appreciation Night|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/armedforces-012815|website=nba.com|accessdate=April 3, 2018|date=January 28, 2015}}</ref> as well as jerseys themed by [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], such as Welcome Toronto jerseys, which are black with gold text.

The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division seven times (2007, 2014–2016, and 2018–2020), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season is 59 (2018). The Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals twice (2016 and 2019). Only once did the Raptors reach and win the NBA Finals ([[2019 NBA Finals|2019]]). Seven Raptors have been selected to play in the [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star game]]: [[Vince Carter]], [[Antonio Davis]], [[Chris Bosh]], [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[Kyle Lowry]], [[Kawhi Leonard]] and [[Pascal Siakam]]. With the exception of Davis and Siakam, these players also made All-NBA teams, while Leonard has also made the All-NBA Defensive team. Two Raptors coaches have also made the All-Star game: [[Dwane Casey]] in [[2018 NBA All-Star Game|2018]] and [[Nick Nurse]] in [[2020 NBA All-Star Game|2020]].

==Broadcasters==

==Fanbase and marketing==
The Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. They set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/attendance?year=2007 2006–07 NBA Attendance], sports.espn.go.com, accessed June 16, 2007.</ref> Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season.<ref>Smith, Doug, [https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/253271 "Ticket sales put Raptors in model franchise territory"], thestar.com, September 5, 2007, accessed September 6, 2007.</ref> Their television ratings, however, are considerably lower than other more established Toronto sports teams and most other sporting events aired on Canadian television.<ref name="star-whoswatching"/>

Another successful run starting in 2013–14 led to a spike in the Raptors' support. For the 2014–15 season, the team sold out the 12,500 season tickets, the first time it occurred since 2011.<ref>Westhead, Rick.

MLSE decided to endorse this practice by setting up concession stands and branded sponsorships at the square with naming rights sold to [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford Motor Company's Canadian operations]], along with increased security. At times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room.<ref>Levinson King, Robin.

The value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125&nbsp;million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148&nbsp;million in 2000 to $297&nbsp;million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315&nbsp;million in 2006 to $373&nbsp;million in 2007, and $400&nbsp;million in 2008. By 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated the Raptors were worth $1.4&nbsp;billion, 12th in the NBA.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/32/biz_06nba_Toronto-Raptors_321933.html NBA Team Valuations], forbes.com/lists, January 25, 2007, accessed June 15, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/32/biz_07nba_Toronto-Raptors_321933.html #14 Toronto Raptors], forbes.com, December 6, 2007, accessed February 6, 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/32/nba08_NBA-Team-Valuations_Value.html NBA Team Valuations], forbes.com, December 3, 2008, accessed December 6, 2008.</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/teams/toronto-raptors/ The Business of Basketball: Toronto Raptors], forbes.com, accessed May 4, 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/32/basketball-valuations-11_Toronto-Raptors_321933.html NBA Team Valuations], forbes.com, accessed November 15, 2011.</ref><ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbespr/2018/02/07/forbes-releases-20th-annual-nba-team-valuations/#306b751734e6 NBA Team Valuations 2018], forbes.com, accessed February 7, 2018.</ref>

{{see also|List of NBA mascots}}
On game day, the fans are usually entertained by the Raptor [[mascot]], the Raptors Dance Pak, and the 4 Korners Raptors Soundcrew during pre-game, [[time-out (sport)|time-outs]], and intervals. During the 2013–14 season, a new "[[Drake (musician)|Drake]] Zone" was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to fans sitting in the Drake Zone. Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a [[Mozzarella|cheese]] or [[pepperoni]] pizza slice at standalone [[Pizza Pizza]] locations throughout Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zwolinski|first1=Mark|title=Toronto Raptors fans hungry for 100 point-pizza promo|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/basketball/raptors/2012/03/28/toronto_raptors_fans_hungry_for_100_pointpizza_promo.html|accessdate=April 2, 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> However, beginning in the [[2018–19 Toronto Raptors season|2018–19 season]], the promotion added an extra requirement of purchasing a first slice before receiving the free second slice, though it requires using the Pizza Pizza mobile app instead of using a Raptors ticket, allowing Raptors fans who did not attend the game to receive a free second slice after purchasing a first slice.<ref name="New Pizza Promo">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2018/10/20/pizza-promotion-change-just-one-of-many-new-wrinkles-at-raptors-games-this-season.html|title=Pizza promotion change just one of many new wrinkles at Raptors games this season - The Star|website=thestar.com}}</ref> Beginning in the same NBA season, [[McDonald's Canada|McDonald's Canadian operations]] also offer fans in Ontario using the McDonald's Canada mobile app, regardless of game attendance, a free medium-sized serving of [[French fries]] with a minimum C$1 purchase of another item the next day after when the Raptors make at least a dozen successful three-pointers in home or away games regardless of final outcome.<ref name="New Pizza Promo"/>

===Partnership with Drake===

===="We The North" re-branding====
[[File:Nets vs Raptors Game 2 2014 playoffs.jpg|thumb|Toronto-based hip-hop musician [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] stands courtside during the first round of the [[2014 NBA playoffs|2014 playoffs]]. Drake was named the "global ambassador" for the Raptors in September 2013.]]
In the lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015 and its hosting of the [[2016 NBA All-Star Game|2016 All-Star Game]], the Raptors began the process of re-branding itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] was announced as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/raptors-sign-rap-star-drake-to-add-flash-promote-all-star-game/article14597789/|title=Raptors sign rap star Drake to add flash, promote all-star game |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=September 30, 2013|date=September 30, 2013}}</ref> In April 2014, the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency [[Sid Lee]], "We The North", built around a [[manifesto]] that was meant to embrace the team's trait of being an "outsider" from the "north side", and the accompanying feelings of players and fans.<ref name=gandm-wethenorth/>

The "We The North" campaign was originally to be launched during the 2015–16 season; however, the launch was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, "We The North"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while [[Ryerson University]] sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to [[Molson]]'s former "[[I Am Canadian]]" [[alcohol advertising]] campaign in how it resonated with the country.<ref name=gandm-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=How the Raptors redefined their brand – and took Toronto by the throat|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/how-the-raptors-redefined-their-brand-and-took-toronto-by-the-throat/article21360335/|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=October 28, 2014|first=Rachel|last=Brady}}</ref><ref name=torstar-wethenorth>{{cite news|title=Raptors rebrand and embrace The North|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2014/04/16/raptors_rebrand_and_embrace_the_north.html|accessdate=January 16, 2015|work=Toronto Star}}</ref>

On December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during the 2015–2016 season.<ref name="NewRaptorsLogo" /> The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of coloured versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.<ref name=torstar-raptorsbaffled>{{cite web|title=Raptors' launch of new logo baffles marketing experts|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2014/12/22/raptors_launch_of_new_logo_baffles_marketing_experts.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref> There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design—in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake distanced himself from the "execution" of the new logo.<ref name=gandm-newlogo2015>{{cite web|title=Kelly: Botched logo rollout first sign of trouble in Raptors, Drake partnership|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/basketball/kelly-drake-raptors-at-odds-over-new-logo/article22176489/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}</ref>

====Welcome Toronto====
In 2018, Drake unveiled the Welcome Toronto program with the Raptors. As a part of the program, the Raptors wore "city edition" uniforms for six home games throughout the [[2017–18 NBA season|2017–18 season]]. As a salute to the earlier We the North campaign, the uniforms feature a gold [[chevron (insignia)|chevron]] with "NORTH" written across it. The six Welcome Toronto home games also featured an [[OVO Sound|OVO]]-themed black and gold home court, with chevrons pointing north.<ref name=WelTT>{{cite web|title=Welcome Toronto|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/welcometoronto|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Raptors.com|accessdate=March 30, 2018}}</ref> In addition to the Welcome Toronto home games, it was also announced that the Raptors and OVO would donate $1 million in order to refurbish local community basketball courts, as well as another $2 million to [[Canada Basketball]].<ref name=WelTN>{{cite web|title=Raptors and Drake Elevated Partnership Gives Back To The Fans, The City and the Game of Basketball|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/press-releases/raptors-drake-partnership-gives-back-to-fans-city-basketball|website=Raptors.com|accessdate=March 20, 2018|date=January 17, 2018}}</ref>

==Rivalries==
<!-- Please don't add individual players, as they constitute original research --><!-- Please don't add the Cleveland Cavaliers, since the rivalry is one-sided in favour of Cleveland -->
The Toronto Raptors have a rivalry with both the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.

===New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets===
The New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter to the Nets during the [[2004–05 Toronto Raptors season|2004–05 season]]. The rivalry began to heat up as the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, with the Nets winning the series, 4–2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring a 98–97 defeat for the Raptors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/smith_112108.html|title=What Is A Rivalry?|website=NBA.com|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref> The rivalry was rekindled during the [[2013–14 Toronto Raptors season|2013–14 season]] when the Nets and Raptors battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but then faced the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors' general manager Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. During the rally, Ujiri yelled "Fuck<!-- Please don't censor per [[WP:UNCENSORED]], though the original source is censored for publication --> Brooklyn!" which found its way onto various social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/point-forward/2014/04/21/masai-ujiri-warned-nba-fine-toronto-raptors-gm-brooklyn|title=NBA fines Raptors GM Masai Ujiri for cursing Brooklyn|first=Ben|last=Golliver|website=SI.com|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref> The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when [[Paul Pierce]] blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104–103 victory.<ref name=closest/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/02/05/nets-rewind-lets-hope-raptors-rivalry-stays-this-feisty/|title=Nets rewind: Let's hope Raptors rivalry stays this feisty|first=Tim|last=Bontemps|date=February 5, 2015|website=NYPost.com|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref>

===New York Knicks===
The New York Knicks and the Raptors had a playoff rivalry in [[2000 NBA Playoffs|2000]] and [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]]. The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the [[1999–2000 Toronto Raptors season|1999–2000 season]], in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round, 3–0. The [[2000–01 Toronto Raptors season|following season]], the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial [[NBA Finals|NBA championship]] contenders, which began in the early 1990s.<ref name=closest>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/basketball/nba/the-closest-thing-to-a-raptors-rivalry/|title=The closest thing to a Raptors rivalry - Sportsnet.ca|website=Sportsnet.ca|access-date=May 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2013/02/13/knicks-renew-rivalry-with-raptors.html|title=Knicks renew rivalry with Raptors|date=February 13, 2013|website=FoxNews.com|access-date=May 4, 2017}}</ref>

==Community service==
The Raptors [[Foundation (nonprofit)|Foundation]] was the charitable arm of the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered [[Charitable organization|charities]] that support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players and volunteers, the Foundation had successfully raised more than $14&nbsp;million between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities.<ref>[http://www.nba.com/raptors/community/foundation.html Raptors Foundation], nba.com/raptors, accessed April 7, 2007.</ref> The Raptors Foundation was one of three parts of the Raptors' community service program. The other projects were Raptors Community Relations and Raptors Basketball Development, both of which focus on providing basketball development programs. The Toronto Raptors lead the NBA for amount of money donated to the community. In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment|MLSE's]] other sports franchises to form the Team Up Foundation.<ref>[http://mlseteamupfoundation.org/ Team Up Foundation] mlseteamupfoundation.org, accessed February 18, 2012.</ref><ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/investigations/article/800061--star-investigation-the-high-cost-of-sports-charities The high cost of sports charities], [[Toronto Star|thestar.com]], accessed April 29, 2010.</ref>

In 2018, the Raptors, in partnership with Drake, announced the Welcome Toronto program. The program will see the Raptors and OVO contribute $2 million to [[Canada Basketball]] over the next four years. In addition, the Raptors and OVO also announced a donation of $1 million over the next three years in order to refurbish four community basketball courts within Toronto city limits. The four courts are located at [[Flemingdon Park|Flemingdon]] Community Centre in the [[North York]] district in the north end of the city, [[Malvern, Toronto|Malvern]] Community Recreation Centre in the [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]] district in the east end of the city, Matty Eckler Community Centre in the [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] neighbourhood of the [[Old Toronto]] district just to the east of [[Downtown Toronto|downtown]], and [[Thistletown]] Community Centre in the [[Etobicoke]] district in the west end of the city.<ref name=WelTT/><ref name=WelTN/>
