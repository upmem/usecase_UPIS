A '''dog breed''' is a particular strain or [[dog type]] that was purposefully bred by humans to perform specific tasks, such as herding, hunting, and guarding. When distinguishing breed from type, the [[rule of thumb]] is that a [[breed]] always "[[True-breeding organism|breeds true]]".<ref name="AKC-breed">{{cite web | title=Dog Breeds - Types Of Dogs | website=American Kennel Club | date=2017-11-12 | url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/ | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> [[Dog]]s are the most variable mammal on earth, with [[artificial selection]] producing around 450 globally recognized dog breeds. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type, and [[Dog coat|coat colour]]. Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting, and personality traits such as hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years. As a result, today  dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/nsr/nwz049|pmid=31598383|pmc=6776107|title=Dog10K: An international sequencing effort to advance studies of canine domestication, phenotypes, and health|journal=National Science Review|volume=6|issue=4|pages=810–824|year=2019|last1=Ostrander|first1=Elaine A.|last2=Wang|first2=Guo-Dong|last3=Larson|first3=Greger|last4=Vonholdt|first4=Bridgett M.|last5=Davis|first5=Brian W.|last6=Jagannathan|first6=Vidyha|last7=Hitte|first7=Christophe|last8=Wayne|first8=Robert K.|last9=Zhang|first9=Ya-Ping}}</ref>

A dog breed will consistently produce the desirable physical traits, movement and temperament that were developed over decades of selective breeding. For each breed they recognize, [[kennel club]]s and [[Breed registry|breed registries]] usually maintain and publish a [[breed standard]] which is a written description of the ideal specimen of the breed.<ref name="AKC-breed"/><ref>{{cite journal|author=Irion, D|year=2003|title=Analysis of Genetic Variation in 28 Dog Breed Populations With 100 Microsatellite Markers|journal=Journal of Heredity|volume=94|issue=1|pages=81–7|doi=10.1093/jhered/esg004|pmid=12692167|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="KC-Standard"/> Other uses of the term ''breed'' when referring to dogs include [[purebred dog|pure breed]]s, [[dog crossbreed|cross-breeds]], [[Mixed breed dog|mixed breeds]] and [[Landrace#dogs|natural breeds]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dogsanddog.com/|title=Dog Breed Profiles|website=Dog Breed Profiles|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> 

The origins of dogs date back thousands of years, having evolved as domesticated descendants of the [[wolf]], whereas modern dog breeds date back to the late 19th century. Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. Form was given a more prominent role than function.<ref name="Worboys 2019">{{cite web | last=Worboys | first=Michael | title=The history of dog breeds | website=The Week | date=2019-04-13 | url=https://theweek.com/articles/832600/history-dog-breeds | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref name="KC-Standard">{{cite web | title=About Breed Standards | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/dog-showing/breed-standards/about-breed-standards/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs.<ref name="KC-Standard"/> Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning.

[[The Kennel Club]] in the UK was founded in 1873, and was the world's first national kennel club and breed registry.<ref name="KC-founding">{{cite web | title=History of the Kennel Club | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/about-the-kennel-club/history-of-the-kennel-club/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> They became the guardians of their country's breed standards. Over time, other breed registries followed suit.

==First dog breeds==
[[File:Engagé mit einem indianischen Hundeschlitten by Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sled dog]] types, sketched in 1833]]
[[File:Tesem2.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Tesem]], an ancient Egyptian sighthound]]

The domestic dog is the first species, and the only large [[carnivore]], to have been domesticated. Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog–wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>

In 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>

Between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia. Mastiff-type dogs were kept for guarding and hunting, and short-legged dogs were also bred.<ref>Clutton-Brock, J., 1995.

==Genetic evidence of breeds==
Domestic dogs are the most variable of mammals. Strong [[artificial selection]] has developed around 450 globally recognized breeds. These breeds possess distinct [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] traits including body size, skull shape, tail [[phenotype]], fur colour and fur type. They also possess behavioral traits including herding, guarding, and hunting, in addition to personality traits such as aggression, boldness, or hypersocial behavior. Most of these breeds were developed within the last 200 years using only small numbers of [[Founder effect|founders]]. As a result, the large phenotypic variation across dog breeds can be studied through the analysis with only a small number of [[genetic markers]].<ref name=Ostrander2019/>

===Ancient dog breeds===
"Ancient breed" is a term formerly, but no longer, used for a particular group of dog breeds by the American Kennel Club.<ref name="American Kennel Club 2006"/><ref>{{cite web|author=American Kennel Club|title=Dog breed groups|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/groups/}}</ref> These breeds were referred to as "ancient", as opposed to modern, breeds because historically it was believed their origins dated back more than 500 years. 

In 2004, a study looked at the [[Microsatellite#Analysis of microsatellites|microsatellite]]s of 414 purebred dogs representing 85 breeds. The study found that dog breeds were so genetically distinct that 99% of individual dogs could be correctly assigned to their breed based on their [[genotype]], indicating that breeding barriers (pure-bred breeding) have led to distinct genetic units. The study identified 9 breeds that could be represented on the branches of a [[phylogenetic tree]] which grouped together with strong statistical support and could be separated from the other breeds with a modern European origin. These 9 breeds had been referred to as "ancient breeds". The study found that the [[Pharaoh Hound]] and [[Ibizan Hound]] were not as old as once believed; rather, they had been recreated from combinations of other breeds, and that the [[Norwegian Elkhound]] grouped with the other European dogs despite reports of direct Scandinavian origins dating back 5,000 years.<ref name=parker2004/>

===Dog types===
[[File:Five different types of dogs, woodcut, 1547 Wellcome L0029217.jpg|thumb|"Five different types of dogs", c. 1547.]]

{{further|Dog type}}

[[Dog types]] are broad categories of dogs based on form, function or style of work, lineage, or appearance. In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. 

The spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830–1900).<ref name="Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World"/><ref name="American Kennel Club 2006"/> In 2010, a study looked at 48,000&nbsp;[[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 912&nbsp;dogs representing 85&nbsp;breeds.<ref name="vonHoldt_etal_2010">{{cite journal |first1=Bridgett |last1=vonHoldt |date=2010-03-17 |title=Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature08837 |pmid=20237475 |volume=464 |issue=7290 |pages=898–902 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..898V |pmc=3494089 |last2=Lohmueller |first2=Kirk E. |last3=Han |first3=Eunjung |last4=Parker |first4=Heidi G. |last5=Quignon |first5=Pascale |last6=Degenhardt |first6=Jeremiah D. |last7=Boyko |first7=Adam R. |last8=Earl |first8=Dent A. |last9=Auton |first9=Adam |last10=Reynolds |first10=Andy |last11=Bryc |first11=Kasia |last12=Brisbin |first12=Abra |last13=Knowles |first13=James C. |last14=Mosher |first14=Dana S. |last15=Spady |first15=Tyrone C. |last16=Elkahloun |first16=Abdel |last17=Geffen |first17=Eli |last18=Pilot |first18=Malgorzata |last19=Jedrzejewski |first19=Wlodzimierz |last20=Greco |first20=Claudia |last21=Randi |first21=Ettore |last22=Bannasch |first22=Danika |last23=Wilton |first23=Alan |last24=Shearman |first24=Jeremy |last25=Musiani |first25=Marco |last26=Cargill |first26=Michelle |last27=Jones |first27=Paul G. |last28=Qian |first28=Zuwei |last29=Huang |first29=Wei |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

The study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to [[phenotype]] or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;‘ancient breeds’ to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name="vonHoldt_etal_2010" />

The study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. 
*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,
*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])
*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name="vonHoldt_etal_2010" />

===Basal breeds===
In 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]]. The study referred to these 16 as [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be "ancient breeds".<ref name=larson2012/>

The 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>

Of the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>

===Medical research===
As dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181–2183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Breed temperament===
In 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations. Other temperaments may be due to the legacies of 'ancient' ancestry.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-53994-7_2 |chapter=Dog Breeds and Their Behavior |title=Domestic Dog Cognition and Behavior |pages=31 |year=2014 |last1=Serpell |first1=James A. |last2=Duffy |first2=Deborah L. |isbn=978-3-642-53993-0}}</ref>

Groups of owners that have dogs of the same breed and have an interest in [[dog breeding]] can form national [[Kennel clubs]]. Kennel Clubs maintain [[breed standard]]s, record [[Pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s in a [[breed registry]] (or studbook), and issue the rules for [[conformation dog show]]s and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as [[breed registry|registries]], which are lists of adult [[purebred]] dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents.

A dog breed is represented by a sufficient number of individuals to stably transfer its specific characteristics over generations. Dogs of same [[breed]] have similar characteristics of appearance and behavior, primarily because they come from a select set of ancestors who had the same characteristics.<ref name="{{ISBN|0764573020}} ">{{cite book |author1=Donna L. Morden |author2=Seranne, Ann |author3=Wendell J.

An individual dog is identified as a member of a breed through proof of ancestry, using genetic analysis or written records of ancestry. Without such proof, identification of a specific breed is not reliable.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.grapevine.net/~wolf2dog/review.htm |title= The New Breed Of Municipal Dog Control Laws:Are They Constitutional? |author= Lynn Marmer |year= 1984 |work= first published in the University of Cincinnati Law Review |quote=  The court found it was impossible to identify the breed of an unregistered dog. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000926031554/http://www.grapevine.net/~wolf2dog/review.htm |archive-date=2000-09-26 |accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> Such records, called [[stud book]]s, may be maintained by individuals, clubs, or other organizations.

Kennel clubs provide the recognition of distinct dog breeds, but there are many independent clubs with differing, and sometimes inconsistent standards and they need not apply scientific standards. Four varieties of the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog]] are recognised as four distinct breeds by the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/pdf/breed_groups/working_standard.pdf | title=Standards of the Breeds: Group 5 – Working | publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club}}</ref> Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the [[Feist (dog)|feist]] is a hunting dog raised in the [[Southern United States]] for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other [[dog type]]s and breeds. However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.

A dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. Purebred dog breeders of today "have inherited a breeding paradigm that is, at the very least, a bit anachronistic in light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a pretty blatant misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable."<ref name="Budiansky">{{Cite book | last =Budiansky" | first =Stephen | publication-date =2000 | title =The Truth About Dogs; an Inquiry into the Ancestry, Social Conventions, Mental Habits, and Moral Fiber of Canis familiaris | location =New York, U.S.A. | publisher =Viking Penguin | page =[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 35] | isbn =978-0-670-89272-3 | year =2000 | url =https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 }}</ref> The American Kennel Club allows [[mixed-breed dog]]s to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL).<ref name="AKC-Mixed">{{cite web | title=Get Started - Register Your Mixed Breed Dog With AKC Canine Partners | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-07-28 | url=https://www.akc.org/register/information/canine-partners/get-started/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> California Assembly Act AB 1634 was a bill introduced in 2007 that would require all non-working dogs of mixed breed over the age of 6 months to be neutered or spayed.<ref name="ab1634">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165548/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |archive-date=25 October 2009 }}</ref> The bill was morally controversial, leading the American Kennel Club to fight the bill.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222300/http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

====Breed standards====
The [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/about/glossary.cfm American Kennel Club Glossary]</ref> Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called ''[[Fault (dog)|faults]]''). In addition, most breed standards include a historical section, describing the place of origin and the original work done by the breed or its ancestor [[Dog type|types]].

Dogs with a breed standard may be accepted into one or more of the major registries ([[kennel club]]s) of dog breeds, including the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] (formed 1911, covering 98 countries<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/en/members/|title=FCI members and contract partners|website=www.fci.be}}</ref>), [[The Kennel Club]] (1873, UK), [[American Kennel Club]] (1884), [[New Zealand Kennel Club]] (1886), [[Canadian Kennel Club]] (1888), [[United Kennel Club]] (1898), [[United Kennel Clubs International]] (UCI, Germany 1976), [[Australian National Kennel Council]] (1958), and other national breed registries. Recognized dog breeds are classified by [[Breed groups (dog)|groups]], such as Hound, Terrier, Working, Herding, Sporting, Non-Sporting, Toy and Miscellaneous; some groups may be further subdivided by some registries.<ref name="AKC-Groups">{{cite web | title=List of Breeds by Group – American Kennel Club | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-01-02 | url=https://www.akc.org/public-education/resources/general-tips-information/dog-breeds-sorted-groups/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>

====List of pure breeds====

The [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] recognizes over 300 dog breeds.

===Cross-breeds===

{{main|Dog crossbreed}}

A [[dog crossbreed]] is the result of mating two different breeds.<ref>{{cite web|title=cross-breed|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/cross-breed}}</ref> "Designer Dog" became a fad in the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/designer-dog-breeds|title=VCA Hospitals|last=Buzhardt|first=Lynn|date=2016|website=VCA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.showqualitydogs.com/indian-dog-breeds/best-dog-breeds-in-indian-climate/|title=Show Quality Dogs |date=2020|website=show quality dogs}}</ref>

===Mixed-breeds===

{{main|Mongrel}}

A mongrel, mixed-breed dog or mutt is a [[dog]] that does not belong to one officially recognized breed but can be a mix of two breeds and is not the result of intentional [[dog breeding|breeding]].<ref name="Ultimate Morris">{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Dogs: The Ultimate Dictionary of over 1,000 Dog Breeds|year=2008|publisher=Tralfalgar Square|location=Vermont|isbn=978-1-57076-410-3|pages=696–697|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjG-LAAACAAJ|edition=First Paperback|chapter=Feral dogs|quote=The mongrel is not a true breed, but it is certainly a common category of domestic dog.
