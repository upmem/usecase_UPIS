[[South Africa]] occupies the southern tip of [[Africa]], its coastline stretching more than {{convert|2850|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the desert border with [[Namibia]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] (western) coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then northeast to the border with [[Mozambique]] on the Indian Ocean. The low-lying [[coastal zone]] is narrow for much of that distance, soon giving way to a mountainous [[escarpment]] ([[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]) that separates the coast from the high inland plateau. In some places, notably the province of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in the east, a greater distance separates the coast from the escarpment. Although most of the country is classified as [[semi-arid]], it has considerable variation in climate as well as [[topography]]. The total land area is {{convert|1,220,813|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. It has the 23rd largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] of {{convert|1,535,538|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

The South African central plateau contains only two major rivers: the [[Limpopo river|Limpopo]] (a stretch of which is shared with [[Zimbabwe]]), and the [[Orange River|Orange]] (with its tributary, the [[Vaal River|Vaal]]) which runs with a variable flow across the central landscape from east to west, emptying into the Atlantic Ocean at the [[Namibia]]n border.

The eastern and southern coastal regions are drained by numerous shorter rivers. There are very few coastal rivers along the arid west coast north of 31°30′S.

In such a dry country, dams and [[irrigation]] are extremely important: the largest dam is the [[Gariep Dam|Gariep]] on the Orange River.

==Topographical divisions==
[[File:Southern African Central Plateau.jpg|thumb|left|300 px| The Southern African Central Plateau edged by the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]].]] 
Like much of the African continent south of the Sahara, South Africa's landscape is dominated by a high [[South Africa#Geography|Central Plateau]] surrounded by coastal lowlands. This plateau is rimmed by the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] which extends northwards to about 10°&nbsp;south of the [[Equator]] (i.e. into [[Angola]] in the west, and the [[Muchinga Province|Muchinga Escarpment in Zambia]] in the east.<ref name=timesatlas>The Times comprehensive atlas of the world (1999). pp. 88-89. Times Books Group, London.</ref>)

=== Great Escarpment===
{{Main|Great Escarpment, Southern Africa}}

In South Africa the plateau is at its highest in the east where its edge varies in altitude between 2,000&nbsp;m and 3,300&nbsp;m. This edge of the plateau, as the land drops sharply to the coastal plain,  forms a very high, steep [[escarpment]] known as the [[Drakensberg Mountains]]. The southern and western extents of the escarpment are not so high as Drakensberg, but also are known by a wide variety of local names, all termed "mountains" (or "berge" in [[Afrikaans]]), in spite of being parts of an escarpment whose top is the central plateau, such as Groenberg Mountain. From the coastal plain the escarpment does, however, look like a range of mountains, hence the names.

[[File:GiantsCastlePanoramaSmall.jpg|right|thumb|900px|Panorama of the [[Giant's Castle]] region of the [[Drakensberg]], the highest section of the Great Escarpment. Here the Escarpment is capped by a 1,400&nbsp;m layer of erosion-resistant lava, which once covered most of Southern Africa 182&nbsp;million years ago. Only a small remnant of this lava layer remains on the plateau, covering only part of [[Lesotho]], and accounting for the Great Escarpment's great height on the [[Lesotho]]/[[KwaZulu-Natal]] border.]]

The portion of the Great Escarpment that could be designated a "mountain" is where it forms the international border between [[KwaZulu-Natal]] and [[Lesotho]]. The [[Lesotho Highlands]] form a localized high spot on the Central Plateau. This is because it is capped by a 1,400&nbsp;m thick layer of erosion resistant [[Karoo Supergroup#Drakensberg and Lebombo groups|lava]]<ref name=geologicalmap>''Geological Map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland''. (1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa.</ref> which welled up and spread across most of Southern Africa when it was still part of Gondwana.<ref name= mccarthy>McCarthy t. & Rubidge B. (2005) ''The Story of Earth & Life''. p. 192, 209-269. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref> Most of this lava has eroded away together with a layer of [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo sedimentary rocks]] several kilometres thick on top of which the lava was poured out 182&nbsp;million years ago. Only a small patch of this lava remains and covers much of Lesotho. It has been deeply eroded by the tributaries of the [[Orange River]] which drain these highlands towards the south-west (i.e. away from the Escarpment). This gives this high region its very rugged, mountainous appearance.

===Central plateau===

None of the regions indicated on the map have sharp well-defined borders, except where the Escarpment, or a range of mountains forms a clear dividing line between two regions. ]]
The central plateau (apart from the Lesotho Highlands) forms a largely flat, tilted surface which, as indicated above, is highest in the east, sloping gently downwards to the west (at about 1,000&nbsp;m above sea level). The downward slope to the south is less pronounced (the southern and south-western edges of the plateau are at about 1600 to 1900&nbsp;m above sea level). The plateau also slopes downwards, northwards from about the 25°&nbsp;30'&nbsp;S line of latitude, into a 150‑million-year-old failed [[rift valley]] which cuts into the central plateau and locally obliterates the Great Escarpment,<ref name= mccarthy /><ref name= McCarthy1>McCarthy, T.S. (2013) The Okavango delta and its place in the geomorphological evolution of Southern Africa. ''[[South African Journal of Geology]]'' 116: 1-54.</ref> forming what is today known as the [[Limpopo Province|Limpopo]] [[Veld#Highveld and Lowveld|Lowveld]] at less than 500&nbsp;m above sea level. The rivers which drain the plateau therefore run west, ultimately, via the Orange River, into the Atlantic Ocean. North of the [[Witwatersrand]], where the land starts to slope down towards the north, the drainage is into the [[Limpopo River]] and from there into the Indian Ocean.

===Coastal plain===
The coastal plain, which varies in width from about 60&nbsp;km in the north-west to over 250&nbsp;km in the north-east, generally slopes gently downwards from the foot of the escarpment to the coast. Numerous relatively small rivers drain the area, being more numerous in the KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Midlands regions, where they arise on the well watered slopes of the high escarpment, than elsewhere. In the west there are very few such rivers because of the aridity of the region.

===Cape Fold Mountains===
{{Main|Cape Fold Belt}}
[[Image:SwartbergPICT3193.JPG|thumb|left|300 px|Folded rock formations of the Swartberg. This extreme folding is characteristic of all the Cape Fold Mountain ranges]]
In the south and south-west the coastal plain contains a series of mountain ranges that run parallel to the coastline. These are the [[Cape Fold Mountains]], whose rocks were laid down 510 – 350&nbsp;million years ago, and were then crumpled into a series of parallel folds by the collision of the Falkland Plateau into the south of what was to become Africa when it was part of Gondwana. These series of parallel folds are in the form of an "L", with the western section running north–south, and the eastern section running east–west, for a total length of about 800&nbsp;km. The right angle of the "L" occurs in the south-western corner of the country, just inland from the [[Cape Peninsula]] and [[Cape Town]]. These folds lie along the coastline in the south and are not much more than 100&nbsp;km wide in total along most of their length. In the west they are separated from the coast by a pronounced coastal plain.

The floors of the long valleys between the parallel mountains ranges consist of fertile soils composed of weathered mudstones belonging to the [[Cape Fold Belt#Orogeny|Bokkeveld Group]] of the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Supergroup]],<ref name= mccarthy /> as opposed to the nutrient-poor, sandy soils on the [[quartz]]itic [[sandstone]] mountains, on either side of the valleys. However, the rainfall is, in general, low, bordering on the semiarid (or frankly semiarid in, for instance, the [[Karoo|Little Karoo]]). Agriculture, which includes viniculture and fruit-growing, therefore depends on irrigation from rivers with sources in the mountains, which are frequently covered in snow during winter. The Little Karoo is famous for its [[ostrich]] farming, initially, in the late 1800s, for their feathers, but today includes ostrich leather and ostrich meat, which is very lean and particularly tasty.

The Cape Fold Mountains are separated from the Great Escarpment by an approximately 100–150&nbsp;km wide plain known as the [[Karoo#Divisions|Lower Karoo]] (not to be confused with the "Little Karoo") at an altitude of about 600–800&nbsp;m above sea level. Geologically and geographically the Cape Fold Mountains and the Great Escarpment are quite different and independent entities.

===Coastline===
South Africa's coastline is remarkably smooth, with very few natural harbours. The reason is that Southern Africa has been continuously uplifted for the past 180&nbsp;million years, and especially so during the past 20&nbsp;million years.<ref name= mccarthy /> The present coastline was therefore once part of the underwater continental shelf, which contains very few deep ravines or gorges. In contrast, a subsiding coastline, like Norway's, tends to become deeply indented where the sea has flooded old river gorges and glacial valleys.

==Regional divisions==

===Highveld===
{{Main|Highveld}}
[[Image:Highveld in Gauteng Province.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Highveld in winter in [[Gauteng]] Province north of [[Johannesburg]]. The hills in the background are the [[Magaliesberg]], which are generally regarded as the local northern boundary of the Highveld, with the [[Bushveld]] beyond.]]
The Central Plateau is divided into several distinctly different regions (though with very vague boundaries), largely as a result of the rainfall distribution across South Africa: wet in the east and increasingly drier and more arid in the west. The wettest and most fertile portion of the Central Plateau is the [[Highveld]], which occupies the central eastern portion of the Plateau. It is generally between 1,500 – 2,100&nbsp;m above sea level, highest on the edge of the Escarpment to the east (the [[Mpumalanga]] [[Drakensberg]]), and sloping downwards to the south and west. Its southern boundary is often taken to be the [[Orange River]], from where the continuation of the plateau is known as the [[Karoo|Great Karoo]], except for a small strip just south of [[Lesotho]] which is often included in the Highveld. To the west the Highveld fades into the dry savannah of [[Griqualand West]], beyond which lies the Kalahari desert. This boundary is very vague. The Highveld therefore encompasses the entire [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and an adjoining strip of the Provinces to the north of it. It receives between 400 and 1200&nbsp;mm of rain annually, and is largely a flat grassland plain. Much of the area is devoted to commercial farming, but it also contains South Africa's largest conurbation in Gauteng Province, the centre of the gold mining industry. But there are also important coal mines on the Highveld which are associated with South Africa's major electricity generating power stations.
 
The land is generally flat or gently undulating. Only a few rocky ridges protrude from this flatness: the [[Vredefort Dome]], the [[Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand Ridge]] and the [[Magaliesberg]] just north of Pretoria, from where the Highveld gives way to the [[Bushveld]] to the north.

===Lowveld===
{{Main|Veld#Highveld and Lowveld}}
[[File:Elephant crossing the road in Kruger National Park.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|An elephant in the [[Kruger National Park]] in the Lowveld]]
The South African portion of the coastal strip between the Limpopo and Mpumalanga Drakensberg and the ocean, together with the Limpopo River valley, is called the Lowveld.<ref name=atlas>Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). pp. 13, 192, 195. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref>  These lowlands, below about {{convert|abbr=on|500|m|ft|0}} altitude, form South Africa's northern border with [[Botswana]] and [[Zimbabwe]], where a 180‑million-year-old failed [[rift valley]] cuts into [[South Africa#Geography|Southern Africa's central plateau]] and locally obliterates the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]].<ref name= mccarthy /><ref name= McCarthy1 /> The [[Limpopo river|Limpopo]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save river]]s run from the central African highlands via the Lowveld into the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east. The [[Limpopo]] Lowveld extends southwards, east of the [[Drakensberg]] [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|escarpment]] through [[Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga Province]] and ultimately into eastern [[Swaziland]]. This southern limb of the Lowveld is bounded by South Africa's border with [[Mozambique]] to the east, and the north-eastern part of the [[Drakensberg]] to the west.<ref name=atlas /> This region is generally hotter and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld.

The Lowveld used to be known as "fever country" because [[malaria]], carried by mosquitoes, was endemic to almost the entire area. Before the middle of the 20th century, the Lowveld was also home to the [[tsetse fly]], which transmits [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] to humans and [[nagana]] to animals, especially the horses of the travelers trying to reach the Highveld and [[Witwatersrand|Witwatersrand Gold Fields]] from [[Maputo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/map/lowveld_map.asp |title=Map of Lowveld |publisher=Saexplorer.co.za |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214095418/http://saexplorer.co.za/south-africa/map/lowveld_map.asp |archivedate=14 February 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The Lowveld is known for its high concentration of big game, including the larger animals, like [[African elephant]]s, [[rhino]], [[African buffalo]], the big cats ([[lion]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[cheetah]]s), the [[plains zebra]], and a wide variety of [[antelope]], while the slow-flowing streams and [[wetlands]] of the Lowveld are a haven for the [[hippo]]s and [[crocodile]]s. The bird life is also astoundingly abundant and varied. This wildlife is particularly concentrated in the [[Kruger National Park]] located in the eastern Lowveld areas of [[Mpumalanga]] and [[Limpopo Province]]s, along almost the entire border with Mozambique.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheretostay.co.za/information/mp/knp |title=Lowveld & Kruger National Park |publisher=Wheretostay.co.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-31}}</ref> But many private game farms and game reserves can also be found elsewhere in the Lowveld.

===Bushveld===
{{Main|Bushveld}}
[[File:AT0717 map.png|right|thumb|250 px|A map of the [[Bushveld]] [[biome]] in northeastern South Africa. Being defined botanically, it includes much of the [[Lowveld]], and is therefore more extensive than the geographical region generally termed the Bushveld. ]]
The Lowveld partly overlaps with a dry savanna [[ecoregion]] known as the [[Bushveld]], a basin characterized by open grasslands with scattered trees and bushes. Elevation varies between 600 metres and about 900 metres above sea level. The Bushveld is one of the largest and best known layered [[igneous]] mineral complexes in the world. Covering an area roughly 350 kilometres by 150 kilometres, the Bushveld has extensive deposits of [[platinum]] and [[chromium]] and significant reserves of [[copper]], [[fluorspar]], [[gold]], [[nickel]], and [[iron]].

The northern edge of the Bushveld, where the plains rise to a series of high plateaus and low mountain ranges, form the southern edge of the Lowveld and the [[Limpopo River]] Valley in Northern Province. These mountains include the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]], and the [[Soutpansberg|Soutpansberg Range]]. The Soutpansberg Range reaches an elevation of 1,700 meters before dropping off into the Limpopo River Valley and the border between South Africa and [[Zimbabwe]]. West of the Bushveld, Highveld, and Lowveld is the southern basin of the [[Kalahari Desert]], which borders [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]] at an elevation of 600 meters to 900 meters.

===Karoo===
{{Main|Karoo}}
The western section of South Africa on the inland side of the [[Cape Fold Mountains]] is dominated by the [[Karoo|Great Karoo]], a semi-desert region that is divided by the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]] into the Upper Karoo (at an elevation of 1,100–1,600 m) and the Lower Karoo (at an elevation of 600–800 m). Separated from the Great Karoo by the [[Swartberg]] mountain range is the [[Karoo#Divisions|Little Karoo]].

[[File:Karoo Koppies Calvinia.jpg|thumb|left|500 px|Flat topped hills (called Karoo Koppies) are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern Great Karoo landscape (especially on the Central Plateau). These hills are capped by hard, erosion resistant [[dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]]. This is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal strata of the sedimentary rocks that make up most of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo's geology]]. This occurred about 182 million years ago, when huge volumes of lava were extruded over most of Southern Africa and adjoining regions of [[Gondwana]], both on the surface and deep below the surface between the sedimentary strata. The resultant bulging of what later became Southern Africa heralded the break-up of Gondwana. Since this massive extrusion of lava, Southern Africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion exposing the older softer rocks, except where they were protected by a cap of dolerite. 
This photograph was taken in the western region of the Upper Karoo near [[Calvinia]]. Note the general flatness of the arid plains between the koppies.]]
[[File:Karoo National Park.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Karoo landscape, showing the shrubland that characterizes most of the Karoo. The mountain range in the far distance is the Nuweberg section of the Great Escarpment. The view is from the Lower Karoo looking northwards.]]
In the southwest, running parallel to the coastline, the mountains of the Cape Fold Belt form a series of ranges that run in the form of an "L" by a series running north–south, and another set running east–west, with the junction between the two at the [[Cape Peninsula]]. The north–south ranges, paralleling the Atlantic coastline, include the [[Cederberg]] and the [[Groot Winterhoek]] and have peaks close to 2,000 metres high. The east–west ranges, paralleling the southern coastline, include the Swartberg and the [[Langeberg]] with peaks exceeding 2,200 metres. The mountains of the Cape Fold Belt form the southern and western boundaries of the Great Karoo. The other boundaries of the Great Karoo are arbitrary and ill-defined. To the north the Karoo grades into even more arid [[Bushmanland, Northern Cape|Bushmanland]]. To the north-east, the [[Orange River]] is often regarded as the boundary between Karoo and the [[Highveld]]. To the east the Karoo fades into the grasslands of the Eastern Midlands.

The town of [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]] is located in the [[Roggeveld Mountains|Roggeveld region]] of the Upper Karoo, with midwinter temperatures as low as −15&nbsp;°C, and is thought to be the coldest inhabited place in South Africa.

The Little Karoo is separated from the Great Karoo by the Swartberg mountain range. It lies in a 290&nbsp;km long, narrow (40–60&nbsp;km wide) valley in of the Cape Fold Mountains, with the Swartberg range to the north and the [[Langeberg]]-[[Outeniqua Mountains|Outeniqua]] range to the south. It is as arid as the Great Karoo, except along the foothills of the Swartberg, which are well-watered by streams that cascade down the mountains. The Little Karoo is the centre of the [[Ostrich]] farming industry, especially around the town of [[Oudtshoorn]].

=== {{anchor|Natal region}} KwaZulu-Natal ===
[[File:Howick falls3.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Mngeni River]] valley near [[Howick Falls]].]]

[[KwaZulu-Natal]] is a South African Province that lies entirely below the Great Escarpment, which forms its western and south-western boundaries. It therefore constitutes part of the South African "Coastal Belt", which is, over much of this region, more than 220&nbsp;km wide. The region can be subdivided into three distinct geographic areas. The [[lowland]] region along the [[Indian Ocean]] coast is extremely narrow in the south, widening in the northern part of the province, while the central [[KwaZulu-Natal Midlands|Natal Midlands]] consist of an undulating hilly, 1,000&nbsp;m high [[plateau]], rising to 1,500&nbsp;m towards the west, at the foot of the Great Escarpment. The Great Escarpment, known here as the [[Drakensberg]], together with the [[Lebombo Mountains]] in the north form the mountainous regions of the province.
 
[[File:Upland South Africa Savanna.jpg|thumb|Upland savannah near Pietermaritzburg.]]
The coastal regions are typically covered with [[subtropical]] thickets, while the deeper ravines and steep slopes of the river valleys host [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|Afromontane Forest]]. The midlands are covered in moist grasslands with isolated pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north consists, in the main, of moist [[savanna]] habitat, whilst the Drakensberg region hosts mostly [[Alpine climate|alpine]] [[grassland]].

Most of the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg are at an altitude of 2,000&nbsp;m, but where they form the border with [[Lesotho]] they rise to over 3,000&nbsp;m. The Lebombo mountains are a long narrow range, not much higher than 700&nbsp;m, that runs along [[Mozambique]]’s border with South Africa and [[Swaziland]]. From Swaziland the range continues south-eastwards for about 40&nbsp;km into KwaZulu-Natal.

A great number of rivers arise in the Drakensberg. These have cut fairly deep valleys, and occasionally gorges, into the KwaZulu-Natal landscape giving the province a very hilly appearance. The [[Valley of a Thousand Hills]], between [[Durban]] and [[Pietermaritzburg]], is particularly spectacular. The largest of the rivers is the [[Tugela River|Tugela]], portion of whose waters are [[Woodstock Dam|pumped over the escarpment]] on to the [[Highveld]] to supplement the water supply to the large industrial cities of [[Gauteng]].

The province contains rich areas of biodiversity of a range of flora and fauna. The [[iSimangaliso Wetland Park]] and the [[uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park]] have been declared [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. The iSimangaliso Wetland Park, along with uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park and Ndumo, are [[wetlands]] of international importance for [[Bird migration|migratory]] species, and are designated as [[Ramsar sites]]. South Africa signed the 1971 [[Ramsar Convention]] to try to conserve and protect important wetlands because of their importance to habitats and numerous species. 
[[File:San Lameer.jpg|thumb|right|San Lameer Resort]]
The region has a varied yet verdant climate thanks to its diverse, complex topography. Generally, the coast is [[subtropical]] with inland regions becoming progressively cooler in winter, but hotter in summer (except on the Escarpment). [[Durban]] on the coast has an average annual rainfall of 1010&nbsp;mm. The average midday temperature during summer (January-March) is 28&nbsp;°C, with the minimum temperatures in the early morning averaging 21&nbsp;°C. In winter (June–August) the average maximum temperature is 23&nbsp;°C, and the minimum is 11&nbsp;°C. The summer temperatures in [[Pietermaritzburg]] are similar to those in Durban, but it is considerably cooler in winter. The temperature in [[Ladysmith, KwaZulu-Natal|Ladysmith]], further inland, in the Tugela River Valley, reaches 30&nbsp;°C in the summer, but may drop below freezing point on winter evenings. The Drakensberg can experience heavy winter snow, with light snow occasionally experienced on the highest peaks in summer. The Zululand coastal region, in the north of the province, has a tropical climate with high humidities, supporting many [[sugar cane]] farms.

Beaches of KwaZulu-Natal are of world-class quality. The warm coastal climate means that visitors are attracted to them all year round. Some of the visitors, however, come for the annual late-autumn or early-winter "[[sardine run]]" along the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, south of Durban. Referred to as "the greatest shoal on earth", the sardine run occurs when millions of [[sardine]]s migrate from their [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] grounds south of the southern tip of Africa northward along the [[Eastern Cape]] coastline toward KwaZulu-Natal. They follow a route close inshore, often resulting in many fish washing up on beaches. The huge shoal of tiny fish can stretch for many kilometres; it is preyed upon by thousands of predators, including [[game fish]], [[shark]]s, dolphins, and [[seabird]]s. Usually the shoals break up and the fish disappear into deeper water around Durban. Scientists have been unable to answer many questions surrounding this exceptional seasonal event.

===Bushmanland===

Bushmanland is an arid area inland from [[Namaqualand]] (see below). Its northern boundary is the [[Orange River]] beyond which lies [[Namibia]]. In the south it grades into the north-western part of the [[Karoo|Great Karoo]]. To the west lies [[Griqualand West]]. It is probably the most inhospitable area in South Africa, because of its aridity, infertile soil and highly saline groundwater. Together with the [[Kalahari Desert]] to the north-east, its rainfall is the most highly variable (in percentage deviation from the annual average), and its temperature range the greatest (difference between the average temperature in January and in July) in South Africa.<ref name= Altas>''Atlas of Southern Africa''. (1984). p. 19. Reader’s Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> Its wildlife however, both fauna and flora, though sparse, is full of interest. Although the veld is too arid to bloom like that of the West Coast of Namaqualand, even when there is some spring rain, what does appear is highly unusual and often hauntingly beautiful.

A highly productive base metal mine on the [[Aggeneys]] Farm close to the N14 highway between [[Upington]] and [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]] exploits an ore rich in zinc, lead, copper, and silver since 1977. Close by, to the east, is [[Ghaamsberg]] which has very large zinc deposits, but the ore is low-grade and, therefore, at present, unprofitable to large scale mining.<ref name=norman>Norman, N & Whitfield, G. (2006) ''Geological Journeys''. p. 217, 270-273. Struik Publishers, Cape Town</ref>

[[Vaalputs]], a nuclear waste repository, has been sited between Bushmanland and the north-west of the Great Karoo, and acts as a ''de facto'' nature reserve.

===Namaqualand===

This is the arid region along the north-western coastline (northwards from approximately the 31°S line of latitude) of South Africa, partly above and partly below the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]]. The region extends into Namibia, north of the Orange River, where it is known as "Great Namaqualand", or "Namaland". The South African portion of Namaqualand is known as "Little Namaqualand", and falls within the [[Northern Cape Province]]. The region is sparsely populated, mainly by Afrikaans speaking people of [[Nama people|Nama]], and [[Khoikhoi]] descent. The original Nama and Khoikhoi languages are spoken in only a few remote areas. The main economic activities are mining, and fishing along the coast.

Some of the more prominent towns in this area are [[Springbok, Northern Cape|Springbok]], being the capital of this region, as well as [[Kleinzee]] and [[Koiingnaas]], both private mining towns owned by [[De Beers|De Beers Diamond Mines]].  This area is rich in [[Diamond#Commercial markets|alluvial diamonds]], deposited along the coast by the Orange River. [[Oranjemund]] is another mining town along this coast, situated in Namibia, but very much on the border. As the name suggests, it is at the mouth of the Orange River which forms the border between South Africa and Namibia. The town of [[Alexander Bay, Northern Cape|Alexander Bay]] is located on the opposite side of the river mouth (i.e. in South Africa) and is linked to Oranjemund by the [[Ernest Oppenheimer]] Bridge. Other links crossing the river further upstream are a reintroduced pontoon at Sendelingsdrift in the [[Richtersveld National Park]], and road bridges at [[Vioolsdrif]] (the main border crossing between the two countries) and at the remote border crossing of [[Onseepkans]].

A vibrant fishing industry is found along this stretch of the South African west coast, especially in [[Port Nolloth]], which is also a major resort town for people living in the interior of South Africa (e.g. [[Gauteng]]), and [[Hondeklipbaai]], (or Dogstonebay), so called because of a large boulder outside the town which, when viewed correctly, looks vaguely like a dog sitting down.

The copper bangles worn by the Khoikhoi aroused the interests of the Dutch officials of the Dutch settlement established by Jan van Riebeeck in the Cape in 1652. Several expeditions were consequently mounted to find the source of this copper. A mineshaft was dug in the "Copper Mountains" in northern Namaqualand in 1685, which still can be seen near the disused Carolusberg mine a few kilometers east of Springbok. However commercial mining was only started in 1859, and over the next 140 years vast quantities of ore have been extracted from 23 mines in the area. Springbok and its surrounding towns ([[Nababeep]] and [[Okiep]]) were the center of this mining activity. But, in the early 2000s the last mine was closed.<ref name=vandeventer>Van Deventer, L. & McLennan, B. (eds) (2010). "The Little Karoo" in ''South Africa by Road, a Regional Guide''. p. 190-192. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref> However, about 115&nbsp;km further inland, in Bushmanland (see above), a large new mine is extracting  copper, lead, zinc, and silver from the "Black Mountain" (originally "Swartberg") deposits at [[Aggeneys]] since 1977.<ref name=norman /> High grade granite is mined in several places (e.g. near Kamieskroon, and Concordia) in this granite-rich landscape.

Namaqualand is popular with both local and international tourists during early springtime (August - September), when for a short period this normally arid area becomes covered with a kaleidoscope of colour during the flowering season. This is known throughout South Africa as the Namaqualand daisy season, when orange and white daisies, as well as hundreds of other flowering species, spring up from a previously barren landscape.<ref name=vandeventer /> A part of Little Namaqualand, known as the [[Richtersveld]], is a national park and a [[World Heritage Site]], while the often-visited [[Namaqua National Park]] and the Goegap Nature Reserve are located short distances from Kamieskroon and Springbok, respectively.

The vast majority of South Africa's border consists of the ocean—or two oceans, which, according to the [[International Hydrographic Organization]], officially meet at [[Cape Agulhas]], the most southern point of Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ioc.unesco.org/oceanteacher/OceanTeacher2/01_GlobOcToday/03_GeopolOc/s23_1953.pdf|title=IOC Oceans - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=ioc.unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/oceansmeet.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215015957/http://www.southafrica.info/about/geography/oceansmeet.htm |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Its territory includes [[Marion Island|Marion]] and [[Prince Edward Islands]], nearly {{convert|2000|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Cape Town]] in the [[sub-antarctic]] [[Indian Ocean]].

The cold [[Benguela current]] is a mineral-rich [[upwelling]] current, which flows away to the north along the western coastline, after having come up from the cold depths of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. [[Plankton]] grow in these fertile waters, and support large numbers of fish, and therefore a prosperous (in the past) fishing industry. Over-fishing has, however, reduced the importance of this fishing industry both for the local as well as the country's economy. The east coast has the north-to-south Mozambique/[[Agulhas Current]], which provides warm waters. These two currents have a major effect on the country's [[climate]], the ready evaporation of the eastern seas providing generous rainfall while the Benguela current retains its moisture to cause desert conditions in the west.

Several small rivers run into the sea along the coastline, but none is navigable and none provides useful natural harbours. The coastline itself, being fairly smooth, provides only one good natural harbour at [[Saldanha Bay]] north of Cape Town. A lack of [[fresh water]], however, prevented permanent settlement here until relatively recently. The Bay of Natal looks, on the map, like a good natural harbour, but, in its natural state, it was dry at low tide.<ref>Glyn, P. (2006) ''Footing with Sir Richard's Ghost''. p. 33. Sharp Sharp Media, Johannesburg.</ref> Nevertheless, busy harbours now exist at Cape Town, [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]], [[Durban]] in the Bay of Natal, and [[Richards Bay]]. Saldanha Bay is today an important harbour at the end of the [[Sishen–Saldanha railway line]] for the export of Iron ore from the interior.

South Africa is largely a dry country, with most of its western regions being semi-desert. The rainfall increases in the east, (the Highveld, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Midlands), and falls primarily in summer. The narrow southern coastal strip receives all-year rainfall in the east (the [[Garden Route]]), and winter rainfall in the west (on the Cape Peninsula and its surrounds). The summers are warm to hot, while the winter temperatures can vary, depending on locality from bitterly cold to cool. Thus the [[Karoo]], which occupies a large part of the western Central Plateau, has a climate which is extremely hot in summer and bitterly cold in winter. In contrast, the eastern coastline on the Indian Ocean is lush, well watered and warmed by the [[Mozambique Current]]; patches of [[Southern Africa mangroves]] grow along this coast.

The southern coast, part of which is known as the [[Garden Route]], is [[temperate]] and green. The [[Cape Peninsula]] and surrounds have a [[Mediterranean climate]], with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers (becoming hotter in interior valleys). Snow commonly falls in winter on the higher ground of the [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]], during winter. The Cape Peninsula has a reputation for its wind: the dry "South-Easter" which blows almost incessantly in summer (December–February), and the "North-Wester" which accompanies the cold fronts that roll in from the Atlantic during winter (June–August). The vegetation of the Cape area consists of [[fynbos]], some grassland and [[Albany thickets]].

The eastern section of the Karoo does not extend as far north as the western part, giving way to the flat landscape of the [[Orange Free State|Free State]], which – though still semi-arid – receives somewhat more rain. North of the [[Vaal River]] the [[Highveld]] is better watered, with an annual rainfall of {{convert|760|mm|in|1| abbr=on}} and a high altitude (around {{convert|1750|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}) which mitigates against the extreme of heat of an inland area at this latitude. Winters are cold, though snow is rare.

Further north and to the east, especially where a drop in altitude beyond the escarpment gives the [[Lowveld]] its name, the temperature rises. The [[Tropic of Capricorn]] slices through the extreme north. Here one finds the typical South African [[Bushveld]].

There is [[ski]]ing in winter in the high mountainous regions: the [[Drakensberg|Drakensberg mountains]] that form the eastern escarpment along the KwaZulu-Natal/Lesotho border, and on the [[Hex River Mountains]] of the Cape Fold Belt, but the coldest place in the country is [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]] in the western [[Roggeveld Mountains|Roggeveld region of the Upper Karoo]], with minimum midwinter temperatures as low as −15&nbsp;°C. The deep interior provides the hottest temperatures: in 1948 the mercury hit {{convert|51.7|°C|°F|2}} in the [[Northern Cape]] Kalahari near [[Upington]].

==Climate change==
{{Further|Climate change in South Africa}}
[[Climate change in South Africa]] is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already [[semi-arid region]], with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as [[Heat wave|heatwaves]], flooding and drought. According to computer generated [[climate modelling]] produced by the [[South African National Biodiversity Institute]]<ref name="SANBI">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbi.org/ |title=South African National Biodiversity Institute |publisher=Sanbi.org |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about one degree Celsius along the coast to more than four degrees Celsius in the already hot hinterland such as the [[Northern Cape]] in late spring and summertime by 2050. The [[Cape Floral Kingdom]], identified as one of the global [[biodiversity hotspots]], is predicted to be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction.

Multiple entities are working to combat the effects of degradation and drought. In the [[Port Elizabeth]] region, national NGO Living Lands had in cooperation with an agricultural insurance company, planted 3.7 million trees as of late 2015, in order to restore the water catchment system and halt erosion.<ref>Barbee, Jeff. [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/23/insurance-company-turns-planting-trees-south-africa-combat-drought-risk "Insurance firm turns to planting trees in South Africa to combat drought risk"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', London, 23 December 2015. Retrieved on 11 February 2017.</ref>

==Environmental issues==
{{Further|Environmental issues in Southern Africa}}
South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to overpopulation, sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by alien species with many (e.g. [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle]], [[Acacia saligna|Port Jackson willow]], ''[[Hakea]]'', ''[[Lantana]]'' and ''[[Jacaranda]]'') posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources. The original [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|temperate forest]] found by the first European settlers was exploited ruthlessly until only small patches remained. Currently, South African hardwood trees like [[real yellowwood]] (''Podocarpus latifolius''), [[Ocotea bullata|stinkwood]] (''Ocotea bullata''), and South African [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]] (''Olea laurifolia'') are under government protection. Statistics from the [[South African Environmental Affairs department]] show a record 1215 [[rhinos]] were killed in 2014.<ref>{{cite news |author=Environmental Affairs |url=https://www.environment.gov.za/mediarelease/molewa_waragainstpoaching2015 |title=Progress in the war against poaching |work=Environmental Affairs |date=22 January 2015 |accessdate=22 January 2015 |location=South Africa |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123231507/https://www.environment.gov.za/mediarelease/molewa_waragainstpoaching2015 |archivedate=23 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
