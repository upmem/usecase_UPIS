''Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style'' (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: [[The Overlook Press]]. {{ISBN|0-87951-479-5}}</ref> directed by [[Dennis Hopper]] and based on the 1952 book ''Hell Hath No Fury'' by [[Charles Williams (U.S. author)|Charles Williams]], who also co-wrote the screenplay. It stars [[Don Johnson]], [[Virginia Madsen]], and [[Jennifer Connelly]], and  features a score by [[Jack Nitzsche]] played by [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Roy Rogers (guitarist)|Roy Rogers]], [[Tim Drummond]], and drummer [[Earl Palmer]].

==Plot==
Drifter Harry Madox takes a job as a used car salesman in a small [[Texas]] town. In the summer heat, he develops an interest in Gloria Harper, who works at the car dealership.  Dolly Hershaw, who is married to the dealership's owner, flirts with Harry and they begin a torrid affair.

Harry learns that the bank staff are all volunteer firemen so he sets a fire to lure them away from the bank. While they are gone, Harry robs the bank, but then has to enter the burning building to save a man who is trapped inside. The town's sheriff suspects Harry, but Dolly gives him an alibi and tells him she will sell him out unless he kills her husband. When he refuses, Dolly threatens to expose him. She ultimately kills her husband herself by overstimulating his weak heart during sex.

Meanwhile, Gloria is being blackmailed by Frank Sutton, who has nude photographs of Irene Davey with Gloria, after hearing about Irene with another woman, her former teacher. Harry, who has fallen in love with Gloria, confronts Sutton to get the pictures, and kills him in the ensuing struggle. Harry plants evidence to divert suspicion away from himself for Sutton's murder, then tells the police that Sutton, who had no job and few assets, had recently paid cash for a new car, making it seem that Sutton had robbed the bank. Harry receives a hefty reward for providing the tip that helps the police "solve" the robbery. He plans to marry Gloria and take her to the [[Caribbean Islands]].

Dolly ruins Harry's plans by showing him a copy of a letter (to be opened in the event of her death) implicating him in the robbery and in Sutton's death, and telling Gloria about the affair. A heartbroken Gloria leaves Harry. Enraged, Harry tries to strangle Dolly, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Harry resigns himself to life with Dolly, and leaves town with her.

==Production==
Charles Williams wrote a screenplay version of his own novel with Nona Tyson in 1962.<ref name="Thomas">{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |title=Director Hopper's back in hot spot with new film |work=The Advertiser |date=November 22, 1990}}</ref> It was intended for [[Robert Mitchum]]. Many years later, Dennis Hopper found the script and updated it.<ref name="Thomas"/> The director described the film as "''[[Last Tango in Paris|Last Tango in Texas]]''. Real hot, steamy stuff".<ref name="Krum">{{cite news |last=Krum |first=S |title=Why Dennis Got Back on His Bike |work=Herald |date=April 18, 1990}}</ref>

A bedroom scene originally called for Madsen to appear naked, but she decided to put on a [[negligee]] because she felt that, "Not only was the nudity weak storywise, but it didn't let the audience undress her".<ref name="Hayward">{{cite news |last=Hayward |first=J |title=Screen Sirens Sense and Sexuality |work=Courier-Mail |date=June 9, 1990}}</ref> Hopper later admitted that Madsen was right.<ref name="Hayward"/>

The director gave his impressions of working with Johnson:
<blockquote>He wasn't that bad. He has a lot of people with him. He came on to this film with two bodyguards, a cook, a trainer, ah let's see, a helicopter pilot he comes to and from the set in a helicopter, very glamorous let's see, two drivers, a secretary, and, oh yes, his own hair person, his own make-up person, his own wardrobe person. So when he walks to the set he has five people with him.<ref name="Malcolm">{{cite news |last=Malcolm |first=Derek |title=The Hopper file |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 29, 1990}}</ref></blockquote>
Johnson found Hopper's approach to filmmaking "a little disappointing, I gotta tell you".<ref name="Trebbe2">{{cite news |last=Trebbe |first=Ann |title=Movie Marlboro Man |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 23, 1991}}</ref>  He later recalled:
<blockquote>[[Mike Figgis]] had written a script called ''The Hot Spot'', and it was a heist movie. Three days before we started shooting, Dennis Hopper came to all of us, he called a meeting on a Sunday, and he said, “Okay, we’re not making that script. We’re making this one.” And he passed a script around the table that had been written for Robert Mitchum in the ’60s… or maybe it was the ’50s… and it was based on a book called ''Hell Hath No Fury''. And that was the movie that we ended up making. This was three days before we started shooting! So he was kind of looking around the table at everybody and saying, “Well, you know, if Don Johnson bails, we don’t have a movie.” [Laughs.] And I read the script, and I said, “Wow!” I mean, the Figgis script was really slick and cool, and it was a heist movie, but this was real noir, the guy was an amoral drifter, and it was all about how women were going to take him down.<ref>[http://www.avclub.com/article/don-johnson-cold-july-dennis-hopper-and-auditionin-205139 "Don Johnson on Cold In July, Dennis Hopper, and auditioning for Miami Vice" By Will Harris ''The AV Club'' May 30, 2014] accessed 8 June 2014</ref></blockquote>
