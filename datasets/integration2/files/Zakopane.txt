The population of Zakopane at that time was 1,805. 934 women and 871 men lived in Zakopane.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/article/zakopane/3,local-history/#footnote_2|title=Local history - Information about the town - Zakopane - Virtual Shtetl|website=www.sztetl.org.pl|language=pl|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref> The first church was built in 1847, by Józef Stolarczyk.<ref name=":0" /> Zakopane became a center for the region's [[mining]] and [[metallurgy]] industries; in the 19th century, it was the largest center for metallurgy in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]].
