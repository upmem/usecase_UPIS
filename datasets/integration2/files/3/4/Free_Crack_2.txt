[[BET]] gave the mixtape a positive review, awarding it five stars while commenting on its "new level of depth and introspection, detailing the difficult balance of fame and authenticity and how that effects everyday life in some of America's urban war zones."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2014/09/09/mixtape-review-lil-bibby-free-crack-2.html|title=Mixtape Review: Lil Bibby, Free Crack 2|date=9 September 2014|work=BET.com|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>

HipHopDX noted that "Every now and then, ''Free Crack 2'' drifts into bizarre, unfamiliar territory. Instead of doing what he knows best, steadily and consistently, he veers into a weird, untested generic type of status rap. When in his pocket, however, Bibby is as menacing as ever, and ''Free Crack 2'' provides its fair share of dark and intricate street rap. The Chicagoan seems most at home rapping side-by-side with emcees of his like, namely Lil Herb and Kevin Gates."<ref>{{cite web|title=Lil Bibby - Free Crack 2 (Mixtape)|url=http://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.2339/title.lil-bibby-free-crack-2-mixtape|publisher=HipHopDX|accessdate=20 August 2016}}</ref>
