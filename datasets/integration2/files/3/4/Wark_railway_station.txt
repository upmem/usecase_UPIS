'''Wark railway station''' is a [[disused railway station]] which served the village of [[Wark on Tyne]], [[Northumberland]], [[England]]. Located on the [[Border Counties Railway]], the station was possibly opened on 1 December 1859, but was definitely open by 1 April 1860.<ref>[http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/w/wark/ The station's entry on disused-stations.org.uk]</ref> The station was originally connected to the village by a wooden [[bridge]] over the [[River Tyne]] but this was replaced by an iron bridge in 1878. There was a single [[Railway platform|platform]], a small [[goods shed]] with a [[signal box]] being added in 1896. It was closed to passengers on 15 October 1956<ref>[http://www.northumberland-tales.com/Northumberland-Central-Railway.html Information on the line from a Northumberland website]</ref> and completely on 1 September 1958.

The [[station building]] and [[Railway platform|platforms]] are still intact, the former now used as a private residence.<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3274584 Photo of former station and platforms on geograph.org.uk]</ref>
