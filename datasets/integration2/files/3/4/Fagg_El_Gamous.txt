'''Fagg El Gamous''' (translated ''Way of the Buffalo'') is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian cemetery located in the [[Faiyum Governorate]] dating from the 1st to the 7th century AD, the period of [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]] in Egypt.

The cemetery was discovered by a team of archeologists from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1980. They were given sole responsibility for the excavation in 1981.

The excavations are done under time-pressure due to threat of incursion by local farmers who wish to expand their fields across the cemetery.<ref name=History>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/news/egyptian-cemetery-may-contain-a-million-mummies |title=Egyptian Cemetery May Contain a Million Mummies |last=Pruitt |first=Sarah |publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref>

The skeletons and natural mummies (i.e. not the result of a professional mummification as used for royalty), seem to be common people; "The bodies have been well preserved, so the organs and remains are virtually complete. The preservation results from sealing in the moisture and the atmosphere of the burial spot."<ref name="Press release">[http://universe.byu.edu/2015/01/26/byu-archaeologists-allowed-to-dig-in-egypt-again/ BYU Press release]</ref> By 2014, roughly 1,000 bodies had been excavated at the site.<ref name="Press release"/>

In 1988, it was noted by the researchers that the graveyard contained an unexpected number of blondes amongst the naturally mummified bodies, as well as oddities in tooth decay amongst the buried; "Of those whose hair was preserved 54% were blondes or redheads, and the percentage grows to 87% when light-brown hair color is added".<ref>C.

C. Wilfred Griggs, (Provo, Utah: Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1988), 74â€“84.</ref>  In 2014, it was revealed that burials seem to be clustered by hair-colour, those with red-hair are in one area, those with blonde hair in another.<ref name=History/>

== Controversy ==
In 2014, the BYU team claimed that the cemetery contains over a million [[mummy|mummies]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/over-one-million-mummies-discovered-ancient-egyptian-cemetery-1479892 | title=One million 'mummies' discovered in ancient Egyptian cemetery | publisher=International Business Times | date=17 December 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Osborne, Hannah}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/49147-egyptian-cemetery-million-mummies.html | title=Million-Mummy Cemetery Unearthed in Egypt | publisher=Live Science | date=17 December 2014 | accessdate=17 December 2014 | author=Jarus, Owen}}</ref>

In an e-mail to ''Newsweek'', Kerry Muhlestein explained "In a square that is 5 by 5 meters across and usually just over 2 meters deep, we will typically find about 40 burials. The cemetery is very large and so far seems to maintain that kind of burial density throughout. Thus, the math suggests that there are over a million mummies in the cemetery, though we cannot be certain of this without further exploration and a thorough academic review process."<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/tale-million-mummies-unravels-293615 ''Newsweek'']</ref>

The corpses were found buried in deep shafts cut into the limestone rock.<ref name="haaretz00">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/1.632624|title=Egyptian cemetery may hold over one million mummies|date=20 December 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=Haaretz|work=www.haaretz.com}}</ref>

The "million mummies" claim was promptly dismissed by Egyptian authorities, since the data reported to the press by the Brigham Young University team were only an estimate, and furthermore these were referring to burials, not necessarily mummies: indeed, the team has discovered many poorly preserved skeletons, ranging from a person 213&nbsp;cm tall to an 18-month-old girl's remains, but the only real mummy ever found at Fagg El Gamous was unearthed in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fayoum antiquities official denies 'million mummies' reports|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/40/118374/Heritage/Ancient-Egypt/Fayoum-antiquities-official-denies-million-mummies.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Egypt antiquity ministry slams US mission after 'million mummy' controversy|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/9/0/118343/Heritage/0/Egypt-antiquity-ministry-slams-US-mission-after-mi.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref>

After working things out with Egyptian authorities, the team was granted renewed permission to excavate in mid January 2015.<ref name="Press release"/>
