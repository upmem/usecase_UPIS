'''Photosynthate partitioning''' is the deferential distribution of photosynthates to plant tissues.  A photosynthate is the resulting product of [[photosynthesis]], these products are generally sugars.  These sugars that are created from photosynthesis are broken down to create energy for use by the plant.  Sugar and other compounds move via the phloem to tissues that have an energy demand.  These areas of demand are called sinks.  While areas with an excess of sugars and a low energy demand are called sources.  Many times sinks are the actively growing tissues of the plant while the sources are where sugars are produced by photosynthesis—the leaves of plants.  Sugars are actively loaded into the phloem and moved by a positive pressure flow created by solute concentrations and [[turgor pressure]] between [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] vessel elements (specialized plant cells).  This movement of sugars is referred to as [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/translocation translocation].  When sugars arrive at the sink they are unloaded for storage or broken down/metabolized.<ref>http://homepages.uwp.edu/higgs/lect9plant.pdf</ref>

The partitioning of these sugars depends on multiple factors such as the vascular connections that exist, the location of the sink to source, the developmental stage, and the strength of that sink.  Vascular connections exist between sources and sinks and those that are the most direct have been shown to receive more photosynthates than those that must travel through extensive connections.  This also goes for proximity those closer to the source are easier to translocate sugars to.<ref>Hopkins, William G., and Norman P. A. Hüner. Introduction to Plant Physiology.

Those with higher sink strengths receive more photosynthates than lower strength sinks.  Sinks compete to receive these compounds and combination of factors playing in determining how much and how fast sinks receives photosynthates to grow and complete [[Plant physiology|physiological]] activities.
