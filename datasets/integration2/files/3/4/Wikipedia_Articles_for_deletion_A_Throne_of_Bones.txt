:({{Find sources AFD|A Throne of Bones}})
[[Theodore Beale]], who writes and blogs under the name "Vox Day", meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability. I fully grant that. However, I do not believe that a novel he has written becomes notable simply by virtue of having been written by him. If it can be shown that ''A Throne of Bones'' meets Wikipedia's criteria for notability, I will willingly retract this deletion request; however, I have looked around online and I have not found anything that would indicate this. Reviews exist, yes, but they are from sources that are not generally accepted as sources of notability: personal blogs, Amazon's "buy this book" page, forum posts, Goodreads, the publisher's own site, an interview with the author... plenty of things for ''facts'', but nothing that shows ''notability'' (a key distinction). Even though the article links to what is described as a  review at [[WorldNetDaily]], it's actually an announcement ''by Mr. Beale'' that his novel has been released. As best as I can tell, there's no coverage that's not either a) linked to those who benefit financially from sales of the book, b) crowdsourced, or c) on personal blogs; that said, I am willing to be proven wrong in this regard. 

Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of Mr. Beale's work, so that makes it all the more important that I do this as fairly and as openly as possible, in full accordance with procedure. [[User:DragonflySixtyseven|DS]] ([[User talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk]]) 15:19, 17 December 2014 (UTC)

*'''Note''': Any searchers will have to specify the author, as there is a similarly titled work by [[Brian McNaughton]] entitled ''The Throne of Bones'', which will give false positives.

*'''Redirect to author's article'''. I just can't find anything to show that this particular book has notability outside of Day himself. Day is most assuredly notable, but this book hasn't received reviews or notice in any outlets that would really be considered to give notability, at least not enough to where this work would pass [[WP:NBOOK]].

*Do not delete. We do not delete plausible redirects on grounds of notability alone (WP:R). Where an author is notable, but a book is not, the book will normally be redirected to the author (WP:BKD). In this case, any potential for confusion with the similarly, but not identically, named book by McNaughton can be adequately dealt with by means of a disambiguation hatnote.

:*I'm confused- are you arguing for this to be a redirect with history to the main article or are you arguing for this to be retained as an article independent of the main article for the author? If so, then rather than arguing "do not delete" you need to instead say "redirect with history". Saying "do not delete" implies that you think that the article should remain in the mainspace. As far as redirects go, this article is not a redirect- it's an article. It could be a redirect if the best AfD arguments are to make it into a redirect to the main article, but it's actually quite common for an AfD to end with the article getting deleted and then re-created as a redirect to the main article.

::*As far as I can see, "do not delete" does not mean "keep". It means "I am satisfied that this article should not be deleted, but have not yet decided whether it should be kept or whether it should be redirected (with or without merge)". As far as I can see, the only reason to delete and then redirect an article would be if the entire page history (ie every revision individually) qualified for revision deletion (REVDEL) which should be an unusual outcome. I think it should be clear that I am saying that I can't see an argument for an outcome "delete and then redirect", which I would only endorse in exceptional cases. If I had my way, this type of nomination would automatically be procedurally closed with instructions to go and discuss the possibility of a blank and redirect (with or without merger of content) on the talk page of the article where it is supposed to be discussed.

:::*Ah, gotcha. I usually just label those as "redirect with history", mostly since the label "do not delete" is predominantly used by people trying to argue against the article being deleted or redirected in any aspect. It was just a little confusing, is all. I do agree that this probably should have just been redirected before bringing to AfD, though.

* '''keep''' - The only thing separating this novel (aside from the irascibility of its author) from some others I like (and which have probably tenuous Wikipedia articles) is its contemporaneousness.

::* I'm a sucker for fantasy novels. (Disclosure: I have not read this one, but note that it is well-regarded in reviews.) In any event, I do not like the slippery-slope I am seeing here, in which roving editors with sharp axes and nothing better to do begin cleaving out swathes of underrated material possessing at least nominal merit, objectively speaking. Meanwhile, if I may digress, the AfDs are flood-filled with "grade-Z" pornstar articles which appear to be passing muster. -- Is this the Wikipedia we want?--[[User:Раціональне анархіст|Раціональне анархіст]] ([[User talk:Раціональне анархіст|talk]]) 17:26, 25 December 2014 (UTC)
:::*{{rto|Раціональне анархіст}}  Good question, and my answer is yes, emphatically yes.  I have no use for pornstar bios and the people who care about them likely have no use for the mathematical bibliographies that I care about, but we share a common understanding of what an encyclopedia is:  a summary of existing, reputable, published, third-party work.  The problem with this article is that we aren't able to find any independent reviews of it.  Were we to create an article, we would be left with what the author says about it, what organizations affiliated with the author say about it, and the unpublished impressions of folks who might or might not have read it.  That kind of article doesn't inspire a lot of trust in readers, so until the independent reviews show up, we delete these kinds of articles.  
::::You mention that you've seen good reviews&mdash;where did you find them?  If we can cite those, that likely means we can keep the article.
::::You might also be interested in the formal descriptions of [[WP:NOTABILITY|notability]] and [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].  There are additional guidelines for what makes [[WP:NBOOK|books notable]] (and what makes [[WP:PORNBIO|pornstars notable]], if you're curious).  And [[WP:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions]] might be worth a look as well.  Feel free to ping me or Tokyogirl79 if you have questions; there is a method to this madness, but sometimes I think we do a pretty good job of hiding it.  [[User:Lesser Cartographies|Lesser Cartographies]] ([[User talk:Lesser Cartographies|talk]]) 18:02, 25 December 2014 (UTC)
:::::Regrettably, the reviews I refer to are the sort of vote-tallies and independent write-ups one finds on Amazon, IMDB, [http://didactsreach.blogspot.com/2013/01/book-review-throne-of-bones-by-vox-day.html fantasy blogs,] [http://jamsco.wordpress.com/2012/12/03/book-review-a-throne-of-bones/ Wordpress pages,] etc. Not anything we can use. The mainstream press has no time for niche genres; they highlight one Harry Potter or Game of Thrones per decade, and that's the extent of their interest. (Continuing the pornstar ramble, the industry has basically learned how to game Wikipedia's PORNBIO guidelines ("multiple awards to everybody!") for endless free smut advertizing, and the encyclopedia is reacting with the alacrity of a tortoise.)--[[User:Раціональне анархіст|Раціональне анархіст]] ([[User talk:Раціональне анархіст|talk]]) 18:18, 25 December 2014 (UTC)

:::::*{{rto|Раціональне анархіст}}  Nice work on finding the review!  It's in a blog, which would usually disqualify it, but since he has reviewed several other books and is an author himself you could argue the expert exemption in [[WP:USERGENERATED]].  So that's one.  Any other reviews that you can find?  [[User:Lesser Cartographies|Lesser Cartographies]] ([[User talk:Lesser Cartographies|talk]]) 20:46, 25 December 2014 (UTC)
::::::* I was busy creating the Lars Walker page, so I haven't had time. But I would gamble he is not the only other accomplished author out there who has a) reviewed ''Bones,'' and b) does not yet have his own Wikipedia page. (If pornstars can get articles by giving each other BS awards, then certainly writers ought to qualify under the same principle when critiquing the works of their contemporaries.)--[[User:Раціональне анархіст|Раціональне анархіст]] ([[User talk:Раціональне анархіст|talk]]) 20:55, 25 December 2014 (UTC)

I don't really see anything on the article about Mr Walker that goes for notability either: both sources are on sites that profit financially from Mr Walker's writing. Not every Baen author meets notability criteria, as I've learned ([[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ryk E. Spoor|case in point]]). Could there be ''more'' coverage of Mr Walker somewhere, enough to sustain an article? Sure. ''Is'' there? No idea. And if we can't show notability for Mr Walker himself, then his thoughts on AToB don't really do very much to support its notability either.
