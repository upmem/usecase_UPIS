It was also later the home of H.E. Williams, the founder of the nearby [[Williams Baptist College]].<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register-Listings/PDF/LW0090.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Commandant's House|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2014-12-17}}</ref>
