Strong worked this claim through the 1920s and 1930s, building a cabin and an assay house that are the oldest known buildings in the Turnagain Arm region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianvalleymine.com/mine_history.html|title=Mine history|website=indianvalleymine.com|publisher=Indian Valley Mine|accessdate=17 Dec 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217162041/http://www.indianvalleymine.com/mine_history.html|archive-date=17 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
