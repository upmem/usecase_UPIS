'''Jeshm Afet Hanim''' ({{Lang-ar|جشم آفت هانم}}; {{Lang-tr|Çeşm İfet Hanım}}; died 11 November 1907) was the Princess consort of [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]] of [[Egypt]]. She was the adoptive mother of the future Sultana of Egypt [[Melek Tourhan]].

==Marriage==
Jeshm Afet married Isma'il Pasha as his third wife just after his accession to the throne in 1863.{{sfn|Doumani|2003|p=258}}<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth M.|last=Cuno|title=Modernizing Marriage: Family, Ideology, and Law in Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Egypt|publisher=Syracuse University Press|date=April 1, 2015|pages=33|isbn=978-0-815-65316-5}}</ref> She was given the title of "Third Princess",{{sfn|Doumani|2003|p=258}} a position at which she remained throughout his entire reign, until his deposition in 1879.{{sfn|Doumani|2003|p=270}} She was widowed at his death in 1895.{{sfn|Doumani|2003|p=270}}

Al-Tahtawi’s book on the education of women, titled al-Murshid al-Amin lil Banat wa al-Banin (the faithful guide for girls and boys) published in 1873, was commissioned by Khedive Ismail after Jeshm Afet Hanim, used her own money to establish the first general public school for girls at al-Suyufiya in 1873, which claimed additional fame to her.<ref name="Taymur">{{Cite book|author=Mervat F.

The genealogy of the dynasty revealed that Jeshm Afet had no children of her own,

Hasan Tourhan Pasha, a captain in the [[Ottoman Navy]] offered an adoption of his daughter [[Melek Tourhan|Melek]], in order to improve her lot in life. Melek was adopted by Jeshm Afet, during the 1870s. While they lost touch with each other following the exile of Khedive Ismail, when Melek Hanim became the second wife of [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Prince Husein Kamel]] in 1887 returning to Egypt with him, she resumed her acquaintance and a relationship with [[Aisha Taymur]]. There was no doubt that the relationship between Jeshm Afet Hanim and Taymur was shaped by their mutual interest in women's education and poetry that reflected the changing interests and concerns of some royal and upper-class women beyond mothering and feminine crafts.<ref name="Taymur"/>
