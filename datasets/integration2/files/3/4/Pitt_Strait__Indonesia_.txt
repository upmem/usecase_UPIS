'''Pitt Strait''' (Indonesia)  (a.k.a. '''Pitt's Strait''', '''Sagewin Strait'''),{{sfnp|Andaya|1993|p=229}} falls within the waters of the  [[Indonesia]]n province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. The strait separates the [[Raja Ampat]] islands of [[Batanta]] and [[Salawati]] and links the [[Ceram Sea]] to the Pacific Ocean.{{sfnp|United States Hydrographic Office|1916|p=272}}{{sfnp|Moore|2003|p=87}} To its west lies [[Dampier Strait (Indonesia)|Dampier Strait]], which separates [[Batanta]] island from [[Waigeo]] island.{{sfnp|Moore|2003|p=87}}{{sfnp|United States Hydrographic Office|1916|pp=266–268}} The Sagewin Strait name refers to [[Sagewin Island]], which lies at the south east side of Pitt Strait, close to Salawati.

== History ==
In 1759 Captain William Wilson sailing in the [[East Indiaman]] [[Pondichéry (1754 ship)|''Pitt'']] navigated these waters and named the channel between Batanta and Salawati Pitt Strait, after his vessel, or equally, her namesake.{{sfnp|Moore|2003|p=87}} He also named the two islands King George's Island and Prince of Wales's Island,<ref>''Naval Chronicle'' (Jul-Dec 1805), Vol. 14, p.140.</ref> but these names did not prove as durable as that of the strait.

The area of the Dampier Strait and Pitt Strait are a Marine Protected Area for [[cetacea]]ns.{{sfnp|Hoyt|2013|p=309}}
