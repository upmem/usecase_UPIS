The '''Clover Bend High School''' is a historic community building on [[Arkansas Highway 228]] in [[Clover Bend, Arkansas]].  It is a single-story wood-frame structure, with a main central hip-roofed block, symmetrical side wings with gable roofs, and a rear projecting auditorium section.  It was built in 1937â€“38 with funding from the [[Farm Security Administration]], with a number of additional buildings added to the complex in later years, including a gymnasium, elementary school, and administrator housing.  This complex formed the core of a major rural resettlement project, which included more than 90 farms.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register-Listings/PDF/LW0052.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Clover Bend High School|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2014-12-17}}</ref>
