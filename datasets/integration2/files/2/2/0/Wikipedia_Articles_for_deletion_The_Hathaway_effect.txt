The result was    '''redirect to [[Anne Hathaway (actress)]]'''. Editorial consensus (not present here) needs to determine whether any of this is significant enough to be merged from history and included there. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 05:48, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

[[Dan Mirvish]] blogged on March 2 that when actress Anne Hathaway was mentioned in print, shares of unrelated mega-company Berkshire-Hathaway went up. His observation was noted by a few blogs, papers, and magazines over the next few days. [[User:DanMirvish]] created this article March 7. Per [[WP:NOT]] Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. An item of humor which got a splash of coverage does not need an encyclopedia article as if it were a scientific theory, in which case it would fail  [[WP:FRINGE]].

*'''Comment''' as nominator: This could be redirected to [[Dan Mirvish]]. [[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 18:12, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
*:'''Comment''' If it is supposed to be a scientific phenomenon, then rather than a few selected dates when she was in the press and the stock went up, I would expect to see a time correlation of all press coverage of the actress against the stock price movement. One could choose dates carefully and claim lots of bogus relationships between variable X and variable Y. [[User:Edison|Edison]] ([[User talk:Edison|talk]]) 22:23, 6 April 2011 (UTC)  
*'''Merge/redirect''' either to the article on the creator or the actress, or a mention in both. A story of note, but in terms of having the legs to sustain an encyclopaedia article in perpetuity, this is too much of a flash in the pan.

*'''Merge''' to some other article per Skomorokh. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 02:55, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' as above. It looks like this was a blog posting rather than an academic paper. Mirvish seems to have based his analysis on six data points. Surely every cool idea that a blogger has isn't notable. I don't think there's nearly enough substance here for this to be encyclopedic.

*'''Delete''' per nominator. '''[[User:Andrevan|Andrevan]]'''[[User_talk:Andrevan|@]] 05:58, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' as a minor blip in the blog echo chamber — akin to NOTNEWS, 'cept there's really no news behind it, just a random essay on a blog. There is no real "Hathaway effect" nor is it an encyclopedia-worthy aspect of popular culture. [[User:Carrite|Carrite]] ([[User talk:Carrite|talk]]) 16:18, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
* Given that the first reference (which is supposed to demonstrate notability) reads humourously and bloggy to me, and takes comments with the first beginning "Good story. Unfortunately, it has a very slight drawback of being completely and utterly wrong.", I am very dubious about this being a worthy subject for a standalone article.  It is a neologism, and as per Wiktionary's standards, I think it needs to show repeated use for more than one year, before we should accept it as a standalone article.  In the meantime, '''redirect''' to [[Anne Hathaway (actress)]], and see if it is worth a mention there before trying ti spin it out as its own article.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 22:41, 13 April 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per Carrite's well-reasoned argument. [[User:HHaeyyn89|HHaeyyn89]] ([[User talk:HHaeyyn89|talk]]) 20:00, 15 April 2011 (UTC)
