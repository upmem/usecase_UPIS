==Early life==
Ehsan was born on January 11, 1982 in [[Tehran]] and learned to play chess at the age of 8 from his father. His early rise in the chess community was swift as he won the Iranian men's championship title by age 14. While also a talented football player and the captain of the Tehran juniors football team at the age of 10, his interest in chess exceeded his interest in football, causing his choice of the former over the latter.

==Guinness World Record==

Ehsan Ghaem-Maghami, then 28 years old, won 97.35 percent of his games which began on 2011/02/08 in Tehran's Shahid Beheshti University, a feat reportedly making him the new Guinness title holder of the game.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Chessdom |date=February 10, 2011 |url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/4-tournaments/5055-world-record-604-board-simultaneous-chess-exhibition-by-gm-ehsan-ghaem-maghami-iri.html |title=World Record 604 Board Simultaneous Chess Exhibition by GM Ehsan Ghaem Maghami (IRI) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002004938/http://www.chessdom.com/news-2011/ehsan-ghaem-maghami-chess-record |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Of the total 604 games, Ghaem-Maghami won 580, lost 8 and drew 16 in a feat that took more than 25 hours and treading around {{convert|55|km|mi}} as he moved from opponent to opponent. "I am so happy to break the record" a victorious yet exhausted Ehsan remarked, adding "... ,but now I have to break my sleep record". Reportedly, a physician, a masseur and a dietician were monitoring him throughout the match. He said he would have put in the same zeal even if the previous title holder was a non-Israeli.
"Iran is great and deserves the best. Let's not talk politics... even if this record was held by another person, I would have gone all out to break it," he said after the matches when asked about ousting Israeli [[Alik Gershon]].
