*'''Delete'''. I'm not finding significant coverage for this album in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]; does not appear to satisfy [[WP:GNG]] or [[WP:NALBUM]]. <small><span style="background-color:#ffffff;border: 1px solid;">[[User:Gongshow|'''<span style="color:#000000; background-color:#ffffff">&nbsp;Gongshow&nbsp;</span>''']]</span></small><sup>[[User talk:Gongshow|''Talk'']]</sup> 04:52, 10 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - No coverage in reliable sources to establish notability. -- [[User:Joaquin008|<font color="OrangeRed"><b>Joaquin008</b></font>]] <sup>([[User talk:Joaquin008|<span style="color: DarkOrange; font-weight: bold">talk</span>]])</sup> 10:25, 10 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - Not finding coverage in third-party RS. While it does exist, the coverage that warrants topic notability on Wikipedia isn't there. <small><font face="arial"><strong>[[User:Northamerica1000|Northamerica1000]]</strong><sup>[[User_talk:Northamerica1000|(talk)]]</sup></font></small> 14:40, 10 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Fails to meet our GNG and music notability guidelines.  Passing RS coverage is insufficient.--[[User:Epeefleche|Epeefleche]] ([[User talk:Epeefleche|talk]]) 20:22, 11 February 2012 (UTC)
