Contested [[WP:PROD|prod]]. After wading through dozens of pages of Google hits, mostly sites selling his self-published book, I can't find anything that shows he is [[WP:GNG|notable]]. Also fails [[WP:AUTHOR]] and [[WP:PROF]]. [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]) 16:59, 9 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Zero evidence of notability, and I can't find anything via Google to help the situation. [[User:Ginsengbomb|<font color=#AAAAFF>'''''ɠǀɳ̩ςεΝɡ'''''</font>]][[User talk:Ginsengbomb|<font color=#D50000>bomb</font color>]] 17:10, 9 February 2012 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' The sources that come up after a Google search are without a doubt either off-topic or not reliable [https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&site=&q=John+Cornet+teacher+-wiki&oq=John+Cornet+teacher+-wiki&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=924l5773l0l5940l19l19l2l0l0l0l135l1446l14.3l17l0]. Not much [http://www.google.com/search?q=john+cornet+teacher&hl=en&gl=us&tbm=nws&source=lnt&tbs=ar:1&sa=X&ei=V5M0T5W2KdTRiALk8ZS6Cg&ved=0CBUQpwUoCg&biw=1543&bih=768 here], either, so this article clearly violates the first criterion at [[WP:GNG]].
