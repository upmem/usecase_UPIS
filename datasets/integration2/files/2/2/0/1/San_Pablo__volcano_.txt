'''San Pablo''' is a dormant volcano located in the [[Antofagasta Region]] of [[Chile]], near the [[Bolivia]] border. It is joined to the younger [[San Pedro (Chile volcano)|San Pedro volcano]] by a high col.

San Pablo was active in pre-[[Glacial period|glacial]] times. After that period, [[Glacier|glaciations]] formed a girdle of [[Moraine|moraines]] and the mountain was covered by ash fall from neighbouring San Pedro.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=O'callaghan|first=L.

The volcano itself is formed by three groups of [[andesite]] lavas which variously contain [[pyroxene]] or [[hornblende]]; these groups are known as the Lower Group, the Middle Group and the Summit Group.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Francis|first=P.
