Notability.  Blogs and press releases.  Somehow, this looks very familiar. [[User:Dennis Brown|Dennis Brown]] ([[User talk:Dennis Brown|talk]]) 17:00, 9 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Promotional tone ("provides ... solutions"); no independent [[WP:RS|reliable sources]].[[User:AndrewWTaylor|AndrewWTaylor]] ([[User talk:AndrewWTaylor|talk]]) 17:06, 9 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''extremely weak keep''' Im generally a deletionist, but this does have the zdnet and venturebeat refs, minimally qualifies as notable imo. [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 17:16, 9 February 2012 (UTC)
** Yeah, I noticed those as well, but it was in ZDNet's blog area, written by someone who works at ''Interarbor Solutions'' rather than a journalist/editor. I guess I'm not as sold on Venture Beat's article (or site).  That isn't an article it is just a mention in a paragraph, which (imo) falls short of significant coverage, with no editorial content whatsoever.

*** the red orbit one is decent, not sure if the source qualifies or not though. In any case, I would not put up a fight if it goes away, just thought it deserved a mention in the discussion at least. [[User:Gaijin42|Gaijin42]] ([[User talk:Gaijin42|talk]]) 17:47, 9 February 2012 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''' Reminds me of quite a few promotional articles we see, albeit with brief mentions in a few reliable sources. Still not quite enough there in what I could find. [[User:Nwlaw63|Nwlaw63]] ([[User talk:Nwlaw63|talk]]) 20:54, 9 February 2012 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''.  For businesses, notability is not about counting press mentions, nor could it be, given the existence of publicity firms whose task is to get a business noticed, and sometimes succeed. Instead, it's about having [[WP:ORGIN|significant effects]] on history, technology, or culture that give an individual firm lasting significance in the development of its trade. I don't see that here. - [[User:Ihcoyc|Smerdis of Tlön]] - [[User talk:Ihcoyc|killing the human spirit since 2003!]] 15:37, 10 February 2012 (UTC)
