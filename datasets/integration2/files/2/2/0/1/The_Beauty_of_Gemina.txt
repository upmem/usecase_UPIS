'''The Beauty of Gemina''' is a Swiss [[Electronic rock|electronic]]/[[alternative rock]] band founded by Michael Sele in 2006.

== History ==
The Beauty of Gemina was started after the dissolution of Michael Sele's old band, [[Nuuk (band)|Nuuk]]. On their debut album, the song "Suicide Landscape" became a number one hit on the [[World Gothic Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gothicera.com/2007.htm |title=Global Gothic Chart – Top of the year 2007 |website=Gothicera.com}}</ref> For this song, a video was shot at the [[San Bernardino Pass]] which was played on [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]] (MTV Europe) and put into rotation on [[Schweizer Fernsehen]].

In the spring of 2008, they were the supporting act for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] in the Zurich [[Hallenstadion]]. In May, they played at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in [[Leipzig]].
After a tour with the German rock band [[ASP (band)|ASP]] and some concerts in [[England]], they completed their second album ''A Stranger to Tears''. It was released in Switzerland under their own label tBoG Music, and in Austria and Germany with [[Danse Macabre Records]], the label of [[Bruno Kramm]] of [[Das Ich]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Imhof |first=Nicole | url=http://www.art-noir.ch/art-noir/interview-mit-michael-sele-the-beauty-of-gemina.htm |title=Interview mit Michael Sele – The Beauty Of Gemina |website=Art-noir.ch |language=German |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> The video for the song "This Time" was again aired on [[Viva (TV station)#VIVA Switzerland|VIVA Switzerland]] and Schweizer Fernsehen. The album hit number three on the Deutsche Alternative Charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.djcharts.de/jahrescharts2008/DAC/index_alben.htm|title=Jahrescharts 2008 |website=Djcharts.de }}</ref>  In both 2011 and 2012, they were in Hildesheim to play at the [[M'era Luna]] festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meraluna.de/history.aspx?MID=2011 |title=M'era Luna Festival |website=Meraluna.de |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
The band mixes elements from [[electronic rock]], [[dark rock]], [[heavy metal music|metal]] and [[electronic music]].
Classical elements are integrated into many songs, thus one finds a sample from a Mozart composition in "Victims of Love" from their first album. Influences include [[techno]]/[[trance music|trance]] ("Victims of Love", "Shadow Dancer" and "Galilee Song") and [[gothic rock]]/[[dark wave]] (guitar on "This Time") that could already be seen in Michael Sele's predecessor band Nuuk.

For their third album ''At The End Of The Sea'', The Beauty of Gemina added more guitars to the foreground, including [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[post-punk]] sounds of the 1980s (for example, in "Obscura", "Rumours" and "Narcotica") and alternative rock riffs from the 1990s in such songs as "Black Cat Nights" and "Counting Tears". However, their music still features the fusion of different genres of rock and electronic dance music. For instance, "King's Men Come", "Narcotica" and "La Mer – Rythme Eternel" have [[breakbeat]] and [[trip hop]] rhythms, while "In Silence" features a typical [[techno]] beat from a [[Roland TR-909]] bass drum.

When the band released ''Iscariot Blues'' in 2012, the album saw a shift in musical style that would later be developed on subsequent releases. This album saw an increased reliance on acoustic guitar and a sparser, lighter atmosphere. Songs such as "Stairs" and "Badlands" fused elements of folk and blues to their established sound, and Michael Sele's arrangements began to mature. This diverse approach was fully realised on 2016's ''Minor Sun'', which drew on every facet of the band's sound. 2018's ''Flying With the Owl'' pushed the band further from its roots into semi-acoustic territory.

The band's next album, ''Skeleton Dreams'', was released on 4 September 2020. The album was met with acclaim<ref>{{cite web |first1=LAy |title=CD Review: The Beauty of Gemina - Skeleton Dreams |url=https://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-a-e-cdreviews-131/20614-cd-review-beauty-of-gemina-the-skeleton-dreams |website=Reflections of Darkness |publisher=Reflections of Darkness |accessdate=22 October 2020}}</ref>, and reintroduced more electric instrumentation largely absent from the previous release.

== Lyrics ==
Michael Sele's lyrics deal with issues such as suicide, depression, loneliness and heartache. He has also criticized the Catholic Church, specifically by releasing the songs "Victims of Love" and "Galilee Song" as free downloads during Easter 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imscheinwerfer.ch/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:michael-sele-beauty-of-gemina-im-gespraech&Itemid=179 |title=Michael Sele (Beauty of Gemina) – im Gespräch |newspaper=Imscheinwerfer |date=May 5, 2009 |first=Janosch |last=Tröhler | first2=Cornelius |last2=Fischer |language=German |quote=Sele: „Die Beweggründe waren einmal mehr die Negativschlagzeilen um den Papst. Diesmal die unsägliche Geschichte um Richard Williamson, den Holocaust-Leugner. Die Thematik um die Institution „Kirche" hat mich als Songwriter allerdings bereits bei beiden Alben beschäftigt. Auf dem Debütalbum war es der Song Victims of Love (Qui Tollis) und auf der zweiten Scheibe dann der Galilee Song. }}</ref> A significant feature of most songs by The Beauty of Gemina is the amount of repetition in the text. Songs with the traditional style of verse and chorus are rare.
