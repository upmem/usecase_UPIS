Welcome to the File Upload Wizard. This page is for uploading images and other media files to Wikipedia. When you click the link below, the wizard will guide you through a questionnaire prompting you for the appropriate copyright and sourcing information for each file. Please ensure you understand [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|copyright]] and the [[Wikipedia:Image use policy|image use policy]] before proceeding.

'''You are not currently logged in.'''

Sorry, in order to use this uploading script and to upload files, you need to be logged in with your named account. Please '''<span class="plainlinks">[{{fullurl:Special:UserLogin|returnto=Wikipedia%3AFile+Upload+Wizard&returntoquery=withJS%3DMediaWiki%253AFileUploadWizard.js}} log in]</span>''' and then try again.

<div id="warningNotConfirmed" class="uploadWarning" style="display:none;">
'''Your account has not become confirmed yet.'''

Sorry, in order to upload files on the English Wikipedia, you need to have a [[WP:AUTOCONFIRM|confirmed account]]. Normally, your account will become confirmed automatically once you have made 10 edits and four days have passed since you created it.     

You may already be able to upload files on the [[:commons:|Wikimedia Commons]], but you can't do it on the English Wikipedia just yet. If the file you want to upload has a free license, please go to Commons and upload it there.

'''Important note:''' if you don't want to wait until you are autoconfirmed, you may ask somebody else to upload a file for you at [[Wikipedia:Files for upload]]. 

<small>In very rare cases an administrator may make your account confirmed manually through a request at [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Confirmed]].</small>

*Titles that consist only of a person's first or last name, when that name is likely to be shared by many others (e.g. "John.jpg", "Miller.jpg")
*Titles that consist of mere numbers, of the kind often produced by digital cameras ("DSC_001234", "IMGP0345"), or random strings like those sometimes found on the web ("30996951316264l.jpg")

'''A file of this name already exists on Commons!'''

If you upload your file with this name, you will be masking the existing file and make it inaccessible. Your new file will be displayed everywhere the existing file was previously used.

This should not be done, except in very rare exceptional cases.

Please don't upload your file under this name, unless you seriously know what you are doing. Choose a different name for your new file instead.

Well, we're very sorry, but if you're not sure about this file's copyright status, or if it doesn't fit into any of the groups above, then:

<big>'''Please don't upload it.'''</big>

Really, please don't. Even if you think it would make for a great addition to an article. We really take these copyright rules very seriously on Wikipedia. Note that media is ''assumed'' to be fully-copyrighted unless shown otherwise; the burden is on the uploader.

In particular, please don't upload:
*any file you simply found on some website, without knowing who its author or copyright owner is.
*any file you found somewhere, even if you have good reason to believe it has a copyright owner who would not mind us using it, but you don't have an explicit licensing statement from them.
*any file that was released for publicity purposes by its owners but doesn't have a fully-free license for free re-use for all purposes. 
*any file credited to a commercial image agency, such as Reuters, AP or Getty Images. Such files normally cannot be used even under the "Fair Use" rules, except in rare cases.
*any file that is licensed for use exclusively on Wikipedia, or is free except that the free license excludes commercial use.

If you are in any doubt, please ask some experienced editors for advice before uploading. People will be happy to assist you at <span class="fuwOutLink">[[Wikipedia:Media copyright questions]]</span>. Thank you.

==Upload in process==
Your file is being uploaded. 

This might take a minute or two, depending on the size of the file and the speed of your internet connection.

Once uploading is completed, you will find your new file at this link:

<span id="fuwSuccessLink">'''[[:File:Example.jpg]]'''</span>

</div>
<div id="fuwSuccess" style="display:none;">
==File successfully uploaded==
<div id="successThumb" style="float:right;display:none;">[[File:Example.jpg]]</div>
Your file has been uploaded successfully and can now be found here:

<span id="fuwSuccessLink2">'''[[:File:Example.jpg]]'''</span>

Please follow the link and check that the image description page has all the information you meant to include.

If you want to change the description, just go to the image page, click the "edit" tab at the top of the page and edit just as you would edit any other page. Do not go through this upload form again, unless you want to replace the actual file with a new version.

To insert this file into an article, you may want to use code similar to the following:
 <nowiki>[[</nowiki>File:<span id="placeholderExFilename1">Example.jpg</span>|thumb|right|insert a caption here<nowiki>]]</nowiki>

If you wish to make a link to the file in text, without actually showing the image, for instance when discussing the image on a talk page, you can use the following (mark the ":" after the initial brackets!):
 <nowiki>[[</nowiki>:File:<span id="placeholderExFilename2">Example.jpg</span><nowiki>]]</nowiki>

See [[Wikipedia:Picture tutorial]] for more detailed help on how to insert and position images in pages.

'''Thank you for testing the experimental File Upload Wizard.'''<br/>Please leave your feedback, comments, bug reports or suggestions on the [[{{TALKPAGENAME}}|talk page]].
