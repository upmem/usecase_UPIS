'''Frederick Ernest of Brandenburg-Kulmbach''' (15 December 1703 &ndash; 23 June 1762 in [[Drage, Steinburg|Drage]]) was a member of the [[Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]].  His most significant position was governor of the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein-Glückstadt.

== Background ==
He was the son of Margrave [[Christian Heinrich, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth-Kulmbach|Christian Heinrich]] of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and his wife [[Sophie Christiane of Wolfstein]].  His sister, [[Sophia Magdalen of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] was married with King [[Christian VI of Denmark]].  At the time, Denmark was in [[personal union]] with the Duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein-Glückstadt]], the royal share in the Duchy of [[Holstein]].  Christian VI appointed his brother-in-law Frederick Ernest as [[governor]] of the duchies.

== Life ==
Frederick Ernest was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Elephant]] by his royal brother-in-law.  In 1731, he received [[Gottorf Castle]] as his seat, the former seat of the [[List of dukes of Schleswig|Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp]].  However, he preferred to build his own residence at the site of the manor at [[Drage, Steinburg|Drage]], which the king had given to him on the occasion of his wedding with Christine Sophie, the daughter of Duke [[Ernest Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Ernest Ferdinand]] of Brunswick-Bevern.  The old manor house was demolished and [[Friedrichsruh Castle]] was constructed between 1744 and 1751, after a design of the Danish court architect [[Nicolai Eigtved]].

Frederick Ernest and his wife lived far beyond their means, and when he died childless in 1762, he left a heavily indebted estate.  Frederick Ernest and his wife were buried in the St. Michael's Church in [[Hohenaspe]].  He was succeeded as governor of Schleswig and Holstein-Glückstadt by [[Friedrich Ludwig von Dehn]].

The ''Margrave Room'' in [[Glücksburg Castle]] is named after Frederick Ernest.  He resided there for a while.
