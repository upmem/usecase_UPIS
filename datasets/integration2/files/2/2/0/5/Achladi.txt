A hill north of the village shows traces of medieval fortifications; the castle wall mostly survived until [[World War II]], after which it was mined for building material by the locals. The castle evidently served to control sea traffic in the [[Malian Gulf]] and the [[North Euboean Gulf]], and had visual contact to the castle of [[Lithada]] on the island of [[Euboea]].{{sfn|Koder|Hild|1976|p=117}}
