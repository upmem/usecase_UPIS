The '''Agathonos Monastery''' ({{lang-el|Μονή Αγάθωνος}}) is a [[Greek Orthodox]] male monastery in [[Phthiotis]], [[Central Greece]].

The monastery's ''[[katholikon]]'' dates to the 15th century, which is also when the monastery was probably founded,<ref name="TIB"/><ref name="odysseus">{{cite web | url = http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/gh251.jsp?obj_id=1945 | title = Μονή Αγάθωνος: Περιγραφή | author = Vasiliki Sythiakaki | publisher = Greek Ministry of Culture | language = Greek | accessdate = 19 September 2015}}</ref> although it may have antecedents as early as 1271, when the ruler of [[Medieval Thessaly|Thessaly]], [[John I Doukas]], received horses in the locality.<ref name="TIB"/> 

The ''katholikon'' is of the [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] variety of the [[cross-in-square]] church with two [[conch (architecture)|conch]]s, [[narthex]], and [[exonarthex]], with four attached chapels on each corner. The main church is dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]], and the chapels to the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] (southeast), the Holy Apostles (northeast), [[Saint Charalambos]] (northwest), and [[John the Evangelist|Saint John]] (southwest).<ref name="TIB"/><ref name="odysseus"/> Its interior decoration dates to three clearly discernible phases: the 16th–17th centuries, the 18th century, and the 20th century.<ref name="odysseus"/> The monastery served as a refuge for Greek rebels during the early stages of the [[Greek War of Independence]], and was burned down by the [[Ottoman Turks]], with the ''katholikon''{{'}}s roof and dome being rebuilt afterwards.<ref name="TIB"/><ref name="odysseus"/> The rest of the monastery buildings are of more recent construction, with the originals having been destroyed.<ref name="TIB"/><ref name="odysseus"/> 

In 1959, the alleged tomb of St. Agathon was discovered in the south wall of the ''katholikon''.<ref name="TIB"/> The noted [[Greek Resistance]] member [[Germanos Dimakos]] was abbot (''[[hegumenos]]'') of the monastery until 1940.

Since 1985, the monastery also houses the '''Oiti Natural History Museum''' (Μουσείο Φυσικής Ιστορίας Οίτης), dedicated to the geology, climate, flora and fauna of Mount Oeta and its national park.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lamia.gr/el/content/moyseio-fysikis-istorias-oitis | title = Μουσείο Φυσικής Ιστορίας Οίτης | language = Greek | publisher = Municipality of Lamia | accessdate = 17 December 2015}}</ref>
