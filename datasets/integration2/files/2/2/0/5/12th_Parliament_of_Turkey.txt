The '''12th Grand National Assembly of Turkey''' existed from 15 October 1961 to 1o October 1965.<ref>[https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/TBMM_Album/Cilt2/index.html Parliament page ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209044323/https://www.tbmm.gov.tr/TBMM_Album/Cilt2/index.html |date=2015-12-09 }}</ref>
Actually there is one other parliament between the [[11th Parliament of Turkey]] and the 12th parliament of Turkey. But the members of the chamber of deputies in 1960–61 term were appointed members rather than elected members and usually chamber of deputies is not included in the list of the parliaments in [[Turkey]].
According to the new constitution, there were two houses in the parliament . There were 450 MPs in the lower house ; [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party (CHP)]] with 173 MPs, [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party (AP)]]with 158 MPs, [[New Turkey Party (1961)|New Turkey Party (YTP)]] with 65 MPs and [[Republican Villagers Nation Party]] with 54 MPs. Since no party was able to win the majority of seats, this term witnessed four [[coalition government]]s.
