The '''Apostolic Vicariate of Anhalt''' was a [[Roman Rite|Roman]] [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Latin Church|Latin]] missionary circonscription in northern [[Germany]], with see in [[Anhalt]].

== History ==
It was established in 1836 as an [[apostolic vicariate]] (exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province; entitled to a [[titular bishop]]) on territory split off from the [[Apostolic Vicariate of the Nordic Missions]].

It was suppressed on 1 March 1921, when its territory passed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Paderborn]], whose Bishop (later Archbishop, as his see was promoted Archdiocese) had been appointed Anhalt's last Apostolic Vicar on 19 June 1920.
