Wikipedia is [[WP:NOTWEBHOST|not a web host]] for fantasy reality TV shows.  A request for speedy deletion under [[WP:U5|U5]] was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACallumsteveoo%2Fsandbox&type=revision&diff=681436133&oldid=681435864 declined].    The editor [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Callumsteveoo/sandbox&oldid=681435344 claims to be practising], but has hosted 3 fake games now starting with the original, and then [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACallumsteveoo%2Fsandbox&type=revision&diff=681523381&oldid=681522061 replacing it] when it was done, followed by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACallumsteveoo%2Fsandbox&type=revision&diff=681764063&oldid=681762941 starting the latest] when the previous was completed. The latest is titled "St' Marys Big Brother".  This isn't practice, it's hosting fake versions of the show. Note that this editor likely (per [[WP:DUCK]]) "practised" under [[User:Callumsteveo/sandbox]] as well. [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 13:43, 19 September 2015 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' - This [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACallumsteveoo%2Fsandbox&type=revision&diff=681782565&oldid=681538218 note] makes fairly clear that user space is being used as a web host.

*'''Comment''' - I don't know how much more '''obvious''' it can be.  Since the nomination, the editor has upped the total to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ACallumsteveoo%2Fsandbox&type=revision&diff=682124381&oldid=682123652 4 games] hosted, and has made absolutely no edits to any articles whatsoever. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 14:01, 1 October 2015 (UTC)
