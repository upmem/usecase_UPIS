==Music video==
This music video takes place in two places. In the beginning it seems Ashley and his band are in a basement. He begins to play the song and the walls begin to shake. After that the walls fall and the band ends up in a club with screaming fans all around. He moves to a secluded area and the music stops. It begins again as a strobe light begins to flash. The song starts to end and the club changes to the front of a theater which says "Ashley Parker Angel, One Night Only". The song ends and Ashley throws his guitar over his shoulder and walks away. It premiered on TRL on March 14, 2006 and went to number one soon after.
