*'''Comment''' Irrespective of the actual merits of inclusion, I've blanked the article pending verification via OTRS for the material as it has been previously published elsewhere. [[User:VernoWhitney|VernoWhitney]] ([[User talk:VernoWhitney|talk]]) 18:16, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Wikipedia is not a free web host. There's COI issues with this article, being that the author claims copyright ownership on the material that is being copyvio'ed. [[Special:Contributions/65.93.12.101|65.93.12.101]] ([[User talk:65.93.12.101|talk]]) 04:26, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' for original research, among other reasons. We're [[WP:FORUM|not the place to publish new theories]].--[[User:Physics is all gnomes|Physics is all gnomes]] ([[User talk:Physics is all gnomes|talk]]) 21:44, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
