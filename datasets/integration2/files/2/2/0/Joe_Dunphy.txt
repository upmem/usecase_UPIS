'''Joseph Dunphy''' (born 1944) is an Irish retired [[hurling|hurler]] who played as a right corner-forward for the [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] senior team.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/sport/joe-stands-tall-in-a-proud-parish-of-very-high-achievers-1-2173901|title=Joe stands tall in a proud parish of very high achievers|date=12 August 2010|publisher=Kilkenny People|accessdate=4 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104211022/http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/sport/joe-stands-tall-in-a-proud-parish-of-very-high-achievers-1-2173901|archivedate=4 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Born in [[Waterford]], Dunphy first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he first linked up with the Kilkenny minor team, before later joining the under-21 side. He joined the senior panel after the [[1964 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|1964 championship]]. Dunphy immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen, and won one [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]] medal and one [[National Hurling League]] medal. He was an [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] runner-up on one occasion.

As a member of the [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]] inter-provincial team on a number of occasions Dunphy won one [[Railway Cup]] medal as a non-playing substitute. At club level he is a one-time [[Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship|championship]] medallist with [[Mooncoin GAA|Mooncoin]].

Dunphy's father, [[Eddie Dunphy|Eddie]], his uncles, [[Joe Dunphy Snr.|Joe]], [[William Dunphy|William]] and [[Wattie Dunphy|Wattie]], and his brother, [[Dick Dunphy|Dick]], all played for Kilkenny at different stages.

Throughout his career Dunphy made 5 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the [[1966 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|1967 championship]].

In retirement from playing Dunphy became involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Kilkenny [[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]]-winning minor team in 2003.

==Playing career==
===Club===

After a glittering underage career that yielded four minor championship medals in five years, Dunphy was still eligible for the minor team when he was added to the Mooncoin junior team in 1961. A huge 4–11 to 2–2 defeat of [[Coon GAA|Coon]] gave him a [[Kilkenny Junior Hurling Championship|championship]] medal in that grade.

By 1965 Dunphy was a key fixture on the Mooncoin senior team that qualified for the decider for the first time in a decade. Reigning champions [[Bennettsbridge GAA|Bennettsbridge]] provided the opposition, however, a narrow 2–8 to 1–8 victory gave Dunphy a [[Kilkenny Senior Hurling Championship]] medal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kilkennypeople.ie/sport/gaelic-games/mooncoin-celebrate-a-major-milestone-1-2978182|title=Mooncoin celebrate a major milestone|date=21 August 2011|publisher=Kilkenny People|accessdate=4 January 2015}}</ref>

===Inter-county===

Dunphy first played for Kilkenny in 1961 when he had the honour of captaining the team. A huge 4–12 to 0–7 defeat of [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] gave him his first [[Leinster Minor Hurling Championship|Leinster]] medal. The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] against Kilkenny. A 3–13 to 0–15 victory gave Dunphy an [[All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship]] medal, while he also had the honour of lifting the Irish Press Cup.

In 1962 Dunphy was captain of the minor team once again. A narrow 5–7 to 5–4 defeat of [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] gave him a second successive Leinster medal. For the second successive year Tipperary provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final. Goals were key as a 3–6 to 0–9 victory gave Dunphy his second All-Ireland medal. He remains the only player to captain back-to-back All-Ireland-winning teams.

Dunphy first joined the Kilkenny senior team in late 1964 during the [[Oireachtas Tournament]]. He was a regular during the subsequent [[National Hurling League]] campaign and made his senior championship debut on 27 June 1965 in a 1–20 to 3–8 Leinster semi-final defeat of Dublin.

In 1966 Dunphy collected his first silverware with the Kilkenny senior team. An aggregate 10–15 to 2–15 defeat of [[New York GAA|New York]] in the league decider gave him a [[National Hurling League]] medal. Dunphy later won a [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster]] medal following a 1–15 to 2–6 defeat of reigning provincial champions Wexford. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 4 September 1966 pitted Kilkenny against [[Cork GAA|Cork]] for the first time in nineteen years. Kilkenny were the red hot favourites, however, a hat-trick of goals by [[Colm Sheehan]] gave Cork a merited 3–9 to 1–10 victory.

===Inter-provincial===

Dunphy was added to the [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]] inter-provincial team in 1965. He was an unused substitute as Leinster beat arch rivals [[Munster GAA|Munster]] by 3–11 to 0–9.

==Coaching career==

In 2003 Dunphy was part of the selection team to the Kilkenny minor team. That year he helped steer the team to the Leinster title following an 0–18 to 0–13 defeat of [[Offaly GAA|Offaly]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/other/kilkenny-minors-win-13th-title-in-14-years-105102.html|title=Kilkenny minors win 13th title in 14 years|publisher=Breaking News|date=6 July 2003|accessdate=3 January 2015|first=|last=}}</ref> Kilkenny subsequently faced [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the All-Ireland decider. [[Richie Power (hurler born 1985)|Richie Power]] gave a masterclass of hurling, including scoring the winning point deep into injury time, to secure a 2–16 to 2–15 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2003/0915/sport/power-point-electrifies-cats-608157575.html|title=Power point electrifies Cats|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=15 September 2003|accessdate=3 January 2015|first=Brendan|last=Larkin}}</ref>

Dunphy was still part of the managerial team again in 2004. Kilkenny retained the Leinster title that year following a heavy 1–15 to 1–4 defeat of Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2004/0705/ireland/business-as-usual-for-kilkenny-714077189.html|title=Business as usual for Kilkenny|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=5 July 2004|accessdate=29 December 2014|first=Brendan|last=O'Brien}}</ref> The subsequent All-Ireland decider pitted Kilkenny against [[Galway GAA|Galway]]. [[Richie Hogan]] proved to be the hero for Kilkenny, as his point, a minute into injury time, earned "the Cats" a 1–18 to 3–12 draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2004/0913/ireland/all-ireland-minor-hurling-final-hogan-the-catsapos-injury-time-hero-485020.html|title=Hogan the Cats' injury-time hero|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=13 September 2004|accessdate=29 December 2014|first=Brendan|last=Larkin}}</ref> The replay a week later was also a close affair, with Galway just about holding off the Kilkenny challenge to win by 0–16 to 1–12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2004/0920/ireland/galwayaposs-young-guns-glow-786975736.html|title=Galway's young guns glow|publisher=Irish Examiner|date=20 September 2004|accessdate=29 December 2014|first=Brendan|last=Larkin}}</ref>
