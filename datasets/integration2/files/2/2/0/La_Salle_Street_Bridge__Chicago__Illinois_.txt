The '''La Salle Street Bridge''' (officially the '''Marshall Suloway Bridge''') is a single-deck double-leaf trunnion bascule bridge spanning the main stem of the [[Chicago River]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois,<ref name=HAER>{{cite web |url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.pnp/hhh.il0632 |title=Chicago River Bascule Bridge, LaSalle Street |accessdate=2010-08-01 |work=Historic American Engineering Record}}</ref> that connects the [[River North, Chicago|Near North Side]] with the [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] area. It was constructed in 1928 at a cost of $2,500,000<ref>{{cite news|title=Widening of LaSalle Street, New Bridge to be Ready by Nov. 1|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=1928-09-30}}</ref> by the Strobel Steel Constructing Company.

The bridge was part of a scheme to widen [[LaSalle Street]] and improve access from the Loop to the north side of the river that had been proposed as early as 1902.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Salle Street Boulevard Plan|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1902-04-10}}</ref> The design of the bridge, along with those for new bridges at [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]], Franklin Street, and [[Clark Street (Chicago)|Clark Street]], was approved in 1916.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bridge Eyesores Will Give Way to Beauty Plans|newspaper=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=1916-02-18}}</ref>

The [[Chicago City Council]] renamed the bridge in 1999 to honor former [[Chicago Department of Public Works]] Commissioner [[Marshall Suloway]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Megan |first=Graydon |date=March 14, 2012 |title=Marshall Suloway, 1921â€“2012: Engineer with hand in expressways, O'Hare |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-14/news/ct-met-suloway-obit-20120314_1_southwest-expressway-crosstown-expressway-dan-ryan |newspaper=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref>
