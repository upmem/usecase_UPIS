Fringe candidate with a peak performance of 393 votes in a Presidential Election.  There are a few references, but they are all mainly trivial. [[User:Lankiveil|Lankiveil]] ([[User talk:Lankiveil|talk]]) 02:40, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Weak keep'''.  While she may not get many votes, her presidential candidacy appears notable. [[User:Mh29255|Mh29255]] ([[User talk:Mh29255|talk]]) 02:45, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''(article creator vote). Killeen is a perrenial presidential candidate, and has had multiple articles published about her. If anyone has Lexis-Nexus, do a 1996 search for her name. These articles are not easily linkable. I disagree that all the references are trivial, while some are, they are included for what they reference. Other sources have her as the feature of the article.--[[User:CastAStone|CastAStone]][[User talk:CastAStone|/<sup>/(talk)</sup>]] 02:52, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' The only argument against this that I can determine is trivial coverage, but since this candidate has received unique coverage (ie not just one article copied around) from such a variety of reliable sources over a period of time, I think that that collective coverage cannot be described as trivial.

:*'''Comment''', respectfully, where is this coverage?  All of the references supplied in the article are either "list of minor candidates" style directories, or they make a single mention of Killeen amongst some other fringe candidates.  There are, as far as I can tell, no articles ''about'' Killeen or her candidature that are indepedent of the subject.  But please point out if I am incorrect on this point =).

*'''Keep''' Verifiable --[[User:Ryan Delaney|Ryan Delaney]] [[User talk:Ryan Delaney|<sup><b>talk</b></sup>]] 05:17, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', though the references are barely acceptable there are numerous others on Google News Archive. Because of her fringe pro-pot views ("Hemp Lady") and profession (nun) she has received odd bits of coverage that other candidates with the same level of support may not. --[[User:Dhartung|Dhartung]] | [[User talk:Dhartung|Talk]] 05:22, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' the rationale for deletion here is completely absurd.  [[User:Coccyx Bloccyx|Coccyx Bloccyx]] ([[User talk:Coccyx Bloccyx|talk]]) 23:20, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''  Killeen's candidacy is an example of equal opportunity in our electoral process.  A candidate may enter the New Hampshire primary after making a $1000 fee.  (CSpan network 1-1-08)   If Killeen's press coverage is 'trivial', it probably reflects campaign funds available to her.<small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:71.119.190.52|71.119.190.52]] ([[User talk:71.119.190.52|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/71.119.190.52|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}</small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
