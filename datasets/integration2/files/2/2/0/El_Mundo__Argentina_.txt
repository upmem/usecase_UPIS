'''''El Mundo''''' (''The World'') was a daily morning paper published in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina by [[Editorial Haynes]] company. It was launched on 14 May 1928 and circulated until mid-1967, when there was an unsuccessful attempt to convert it into an evening paper.
Its publication during the [[Infamous Decade]] (1930–1943) provided reporting at a time of instability and repression. After [[Juan Perón]]'s election in 1946, the publishing company was taken over by Peronistas, who forced the paper to take their line.

==Editorial Haynes==
Editorial Haynes (Haynes Publishing) was founded by [[Albert Haynes]], an Englishman who came to Argentina in 1887 to work for the British-owned [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]]. Deciding to settle, he entered into publishing, launching the magazine ''El Hogar (the Home)'', which became a great success. His company launched other magazines which were advanced for the period, with bold design and images. On 29 December 1923, Editorial Haynes opened its main building on Río de Janeiro and Bogotá Streets, in Buenos Aires, and installed modern printing machinery.<ref name=Contenario/>

Haynes' first try to found a daily newspaper, ''El Mundo,'' did not succeed. On 24 May 1928 his company re-launched ''El Mundo'' in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] format, which was easy for workers to read while commuting by trams, was full of pictures, much cheaper than other papers, and featured a weekly competition for a prize of $1,000 dependent on the football results.

Albert Haynes died of a [[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]] on 21 June 1929, by which time the newspaper was already establishing a strong readership. He was succeeded by his son-in-law, British-born Henry Wesley Smith. He ran the newspaper until it was expropriated and taken over by the Alea state consortium in 1939. Throughout this period, the paper gave quiet support to British interests in Argentina.<ref name=Contenario/>

Pablo Mastandrea (11 February 1906 – 29 November 1976), an [[anarchist]], worked in Haynes Publishing for decades as a typesetter, along with Don Emilio Mulli. Both were militant union delegates who stood up for the rights of the workers during the [[Infamous Decade]] (1930–1943). This period was characterized by [[electoral fraud]], persecution of the political opposition (mainly against the [[Radical Civic Union|UCR]]), and generalised government corruption, against the background of the [[Great Depression]].

The writer [[Roberto Arlt]] had a weekly column ''Aguafuertes'' ("Etchings") that was featured in the paper from 1928 until his death in 1942.<ref>{{cite web

In his characteristically forthright and unpretentious style, Arlt commented on the peculiarities, hypocrisies, strangeness and beauty of everyday life in Argentina's capital. These articles included occasional exposés of public institutions, such as the juvenile justice system (''Escuela primaria de delincuencia'', 26–29 September 1932) or the Public Health System. Some of the ''Aguafuertes'' were later collected and published in two volumes under the titles ''Secretos femeninos'', ''Aguafuertes inéditas'', and ''Tratado de delincuencia''. ''Aguafuertes inéditas'' were edited by Sergio Olguín and published by Ediciones 12 and ''[[Página/12]]'' in 1996.

The comic strip ''[[Piantadino]],'' created by [[Adolfo Mazzone]], first appeared in the newspaper in 1941.<ref name="Alposta2005">{{cite book|last=Alposta|first=Luis|title=Mosaicos porteños|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V9HhLpXtB8C&pg=PA68|accessdate=6 April 2011|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Editorial Dunken|language=Spanish|isbn=978-987-21691-3-8|pages=68}}</ref>

==Peronist organ==
When General [[Juan Perón]] was elected President in 1946, he was eager to control the press, hoping to avoid the coups which had been supported by Argentine journalism; these had occurred frequently since 1930. Editorial Haynes was then owned by the Haynes family member Henry Wesley Smith.<ref name=Contenario/> Early in 1949, the [[Peronists]] acquired a majority stake in Editorial Haynes, which at that time published ten periodicals. They forced ''El Mundo'' and the other Haynes publications, to become Peronist. Major [[Carlos Aloe]], a friend of [[Eva Perón]], was made head of the enterprise at Eva's personal request, despite his protests that he knew nothing about the business.<ref>{{cite book

The paper became an organ of Peronist propaganda. Editorial staff were required to hold a ''[[Partido Justicialista]]'' membership card or were summarily dismissed.<ref name=Contenario/>

==Later years==
After the [[Revolución Libertadora]] of 1955, the paper remained government-controlled. It still entered into a new era of journalism under writers such as [[Bernardo Neustadt]], Ulíses Barrera, Ricardo Arias, [[Víctor Sueiro]], [[Jacobo Timerman]], [[Horacio Verbitsky]] and many more.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In May 1960, [[José Ber Gelbard]] called on [[Jacobo Timerman]] to undertake a renewal of the old ''El Mundo'' newspaper, which was bought by a group of businessmen said to be linked to the Communist Party.<ref>{{cite book

The paper went through several changes of ownership and editor-in-chief. In these later years, the paper took a balanced political stance. It was opposed to the military coup that produced the [[Argentine Revolution]] of 1966.<ref name=Contenario/> Following the coup, the company was gradually run down, a process carried out by the dictator [[Juan Carlos Onganía]] and [[Roberto Noble]], owner of the newspaper ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]''. After a year without paying salaries (except sporadic fortnightly payments every 2 to 4 months), the newspaper closed in late 1967; the last issue appeared on 22 December of that year.<ref name=Contenario/>

The brand was acquired by a group linked to the PRT ([[Workers' Revolutionary Party (Argentina)|Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores]], or Workers' Revolutionary Party) and the ERP ([[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo]] or People's Revolutionary Army), who published a successor in 1973 and 1974. Under government repression of the press, at a time when journalists began to leave the country, the newspaper closed again. This successor was not connected to the earlier paper, being printed at a different place and with completely different staff.<ref name=Contenario/>
