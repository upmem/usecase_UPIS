The '''Tour Défense 2000''' is one of the tallest residential buildings in France. The tower is situated in the [[La Défense]] section of [[Puteaux]], a suburb of [[Paris]].

The tower was constructed between April 1971 and November 1974. Its success as a residence was not immediate: two years into its opening only a quarter of its apartments had been sold. In comparison to the other buildings of La Défense, Tour Défense 2000 is relatively isolated, and thus benefits from a beautiful panoramic view.

In total, there are 370 apartments occupying 47 floors, and the building is capable of housing about 700 people. Apartments range in size from 19m² to 140m².<ref>http://www.tourdefense2000.net/j15/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&layout=blog&id=2&Itemid=100003&lang=en</ref>
