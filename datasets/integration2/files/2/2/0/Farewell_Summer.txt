'''''Farewell Summer''''' is a novel by American writer [[Ray Bradbury]], published on October 17, 2006. It was his last novel released in his lifetime. It is a sequel to his 1957 novel ''[[Dandelion Wine]]'', and is set during an [[Indian summer]] in October 1929. The story concerns a mock war between the young and the old in [[Green Town, Illinois]], and the sexual awakening of Doug Spaulding as he turns 14. With ''[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (novel)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', they form a trilogy of novels inspired by Bradbury's childhood in [[Waukegan, Illinois]].

The first chapter, also titled ''Farewell Summer'', appeared in ''[[The Stories of Ray Bradbury]]'' in 1980. Jonathan R. Eller and William F. Touponce discuss a draft of the unpublished novel in some detail in their book, ''Ray Bradbury: The Life of Fiction'' (2004).

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the novel a "poignant, wise but slight 'extension' of the indefatigable Bradbury's semiautobiographical ''[[Dandelion Wine]]''" and concluded, "Bradbury's mature but fresh return to his beloved early writing conveys a depth of feeling." ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' found it "a thin work, heavily reliant on dialogue, but one that serves as an intriguing coda to one of Bradbury's classics." ''[[Booklist]]'' said, "A touching meditation on memories, aging, and the endless cycle of birth and death, and a fitting capstone, perhaps, to a brilliant career."

== History ==
In the afterword to ''Farewell Summer'', Bradbury ... contends that the novel was actually intended to follow what became the ''Dandelion Wine'' story arc as a complete book tentatively titled ''Summer Morning, Summer Night''. "When I delivered it to my publishers they said, 'My God, this is much too long. Why don't we publish the first 90,000 words as a novel and keep the second part for some future year when it is ready to be published'" (pp.&nbsp;207â€“208).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/12/farewell_summer.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209074640/http://www.strangehorizons.com/reviews/2006/12/farewell_summer.shtml |archive-date=2007-12-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
