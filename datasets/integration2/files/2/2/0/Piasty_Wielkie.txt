== History ==

Before 1945 the area was part of Germany ([[East Prussia]]).

The name derives back to the [[Old Prussian]] term "paustre" for wilderness and was first mentioned in 1414 as a location of a mill and a settlement of 4 free [[Old Prussians]] in the region of [[Natangia]] with 27 cultivated and 3 desolate "Haken", a square measure of the [[Teutonic Knights]]. 

In 1858 the manor was bought by [[Bethel Henry Strousberg]], a railway pioneer who fell into bankruptcy in 1875.<ref>Horst Schulz, Der Kreis Preußisch Eylau, Verden 1983 (German)</ref>
