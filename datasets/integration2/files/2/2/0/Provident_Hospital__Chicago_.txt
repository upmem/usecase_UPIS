It was also "the first private hospital in the State of Illinois to provide internship opportunities for black physicians . . .[t]he first to establish a school of nursing to train black women . . . one of the first black hospitals to provide postgraduate courses and residencies for black physicians and the first black hospital approved by the American College of Surgeons for full graduate training in surgery. Provident also offered an important forum, a proving ground for ideas about black self determination and institutional survival."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-12-14 |title=Provident Hospital: A Living Legacy |url=https://imss.org/provident-hospital-a-living-legacy/ |access-date=2020-10-01 |website=International Museum of Surgical Science |language=en}}</ref> In 1893, the first documented heart surgery was performed by Dr. Daniel Williams at Provident Hospital and Training School.
