'''{{lang|de|Himmelskönig, sei willkommen}}''' (King of Heaven, welcome),<ref name="Dellal" /> '''{{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}}{{nbsp}}182''', is a [[Bach cantata|church cantata]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. He composed it in Weimar for [[Palm Sunday]], and first performed it on 25 March 1714, which was also the feast of the [[Annunciation]] that year.

== History and words ==
In Weimar, Bach was the court organist of [[Prince Johann Ernst of Saxe-Weimar|Johann Ernst von Sachsen-Weimar]]. On 2 March 1714, he was promoted to {{lang|de|Konzertmeister}}, an honour which included a monthly performance of a church cantata in the {{lang|de|Schlosskirche}}.<ref name="Bredenbach" /><ref name="Koster" /> According to Bach scholar [[Alfred Dürr]], this cantata is Bach's first cantata in a series which was meant to cover all Sundays within four years.<ref name="Mincham" /> However, [[Widerstehe doch der Sünde, BWV 54|''Widerstehe doch der Sünde'', BWV 54]] has also been proposed as the first.
In any event, BWV 182 preceded {{lang|de|[[Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12|''Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen'', BWV 12]]|italic=unset}}.

Bach composed the cantata for the [[Marian feast]] of the [[Church cantata#Annunciation (25 March)|Annunciation]], always celebrated on 25 March, which fell on Palm Sunday in 1714. Other than in Leipzig, where ''[[tempus clausum]]'' was observed during [[Lent]] and no cantatas were permitted, Bach could perform in Weimar a cantata especially meant for the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|entry of Jesus into Jerusalem]]. The prescribed readings for the day were from the [[Epistle to the Philippians]], "everyone be in the spirit of Christ" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Philippians|chapter=2|verse=5|range=–11}}), or from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], "of the Last Supper" ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=1 Corinthians|chapter=11|verse=23|range=–32}}), and from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the entry into Jerusalem ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=21|verse=1|range=–9}}).<ref name="Dürr" />

The poetry was written by the court poet [[Salomon Franck]], although the work is not found in his printed editions. Bach's biographer [[Philipp Spitta]] concluded this from stylistic comparison and observing a lack of [[recitative]]s between [[aria]]s. The poetry derives from the entry into Jerusalem a similar entry into the heart of the believer, who should prepare himself and will be given heavenly joy in return. The language intensifies the mystical aspects: {{lang|de|Himmelskönig}} (King of Heaven),<ref name="Dellal" /> "{{lang|de|Du hast uns das Herz genommen|italic=no}}" (You have taken our hearts from us),<ref name="Dellal" /> "{{lang|de|Leget euch dem Heiland unter|italic=no}}" (Lay yourselves beneath the Savior).<ref name="Dellal" /> The chorale in [[Movement (music)|movement]] 7 is the final [[stanza]] 33 of [[Paul Stockmann]]'s hymn for [[Passiontide]] "[[Jesu Leiden, Pein und Tod]]" (1633).

A [[da capo]] sign after the last aria in some parts suggests that originally the cantata was meant to be concluded by a repeat of the opening chorus.

Bach first performed it in the Schlosskirche on [[Church cantata#Palm Sunday|Palm Sunday]], 25 March 1714. As Bach could not perform the cantata in Leipzig on Palm Sunday, he used it on the feast of the [[Annunciation]] on 25 March 1724, which had coincided with Palm Sunday for the first performance as well. He performed it in Leipzig two more times.<ref name="Dürr" />

== Structure and scoring ==

The cantata in eight movements is scored for [[alto]], [[tenor]], and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] soloists, a [[SATB|four-part choir]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], two [[violin]]s, two [[viola]]s and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]].<ref name="Dürr" />

# Sonata
# Chorus: {{lang|de|Himmelskönig, sei willkommen}}
# Recitative (bass): {{lang|de|Siehe, ich komme, im Buch ist von mir geschrieben}}
# Aria (bass): {{lang|de|Starkes Lieben}}
# Aria (alto): {{lang|de|Leget euch dem Heiland unter}}
# Aria (tenor): {{lang|de|Jesu, laß durch Wohl und Weh}}
# Chorale: {{lang|de|Jesu, deine Passion ist mir lauter Freude}}
# Chorus: {{lang|de|So lasset uns gehen in Salem der Freuden}}

== Music ==
The cantata is intimately scored to match the church building. An instrumental ''Sonata'' in the rhythm of a [[French Overture]] depicts the arrival of the King.<ref name="Dürr" /> (In his cantata {{lang|de|[[BWV 61|''Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland'', BWV 61]]|italic=unset}}, for Advent that same year on the same reading, Bach went further and set a chorus in the form of such an overture). The recorder and a solo violin are accompanied by ''[[pizzicato]]'' in the divided violas and the continuo.<ref name="Mincham" /> The first chorus is in da capo form, beginning with a [[fugue]], which leads to a [[Homophony|homophonic]] conclusion. The middle section contains two similar [[Canon (music)|canonic]] developments.<ref name="Dürr" />

The following biblical quotation is set as the only recitative of the cantata. It is given to the bass as the ''[[vox Christi]]'' (voice of Christ) and expands to an [[arioso]].<ref name="Mincham" /> The instrumentation of the three arias turns from the crowd in the Biblical scene to the individual believer, the first accompanied by violin and divided violas, the second by a lone recorder, the last only by the continuo.<ref name="Dürr" />

The chorale is arranged as a [[chorale fantasia]] in the manner of [[Pachelbel]]; every line is first prepared in the lower voices, then the soprano sings the [[cantus firmus]], while the other voices interpret the words, for example by fast movement on "{{lang|de|Freude}}" (joy).<ref name="Dürr" /> The closing chorus is, according to conductor [[John Eliot Gardiner]], "a sprightly choral dance that could have stepped straight out of a comic opera of the period".<ref name="Gardiner" />
