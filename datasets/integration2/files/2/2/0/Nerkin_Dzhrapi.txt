'''Nerkin Dzhrapi''' (also, '''Chirpili''', '''Jrapi''', and '''Dzhrapi''') is a former village in the [[Shirak Province]] of [[Armenia]] which was intentionally flooded by the [[Akhurian Reservoir]]. It was replaced by a new village named [[Dzhrapi]]. It contained an 11th-century [[caravanserai]] and a medieval bridge across the [[Akhuryan River]]; the river demarcates the Armenian-Turkish border.
