The '''Siege of Iconium''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Μάχη του Ικονίου, [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: Konya Muharebesi) was an unsuccessful attempt by the Turkish [[Seljuk Empire]] to capture the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city of Iconium, modern day [[Konya]]. After sacking [[Ani]] and [[Kayseri|Caesarea]] in 1063 and 1067, respectively (some sources suggest as early as 1064), the [[Byzantine army]] in the East was in too poor a shape to resist the advance of the Turks. Had it not been for the efforts of the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] the Byzantine Empire would have suffered her "[[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]" disaster sooner. From Syria, a successful counter-attack drove the Turks back. After the attack on Iconium was repelled, Romanos IV launched [[Romanos_IV_Diogenes#Campaign_of_1069|his second campaign]].{{sfn|Lock|2006|page=15}} Further campaigning was met with some success by Romanos, despite the ill nature of his army which had been poorly led since the death of Basil II. 

The victory was a short respite - sometime after Manzikert, in the midst of civil conflict, Iconium fell to the Turks. The city saw a brief return to [[Christendom]] during the [[First Crusade]], possibly under Byzantine rule but the Turks counter-attacked at the [[Crusade of 1101]] and Konya would form the capital of Byzantium's most dangerous opponent. On 18 May 1190, Iconium was briefly regained for Christianity by the forces of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Battle of Iconium (1190)|Battle of Iconium]] during the [[Third Crusade]].
