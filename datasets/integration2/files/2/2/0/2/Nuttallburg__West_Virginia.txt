'''Nuttallburg''' (also known as '''Brown''') was an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] located in [[Fayette County, West Virginia]], named by English pioneer John Nuttall who discovered coal in the area. '''Nuttallburg''' had a post office until 1955. It is no longer inhabited and is just outside '''[[Winona, West Virginia|Winona]]'''.

Nuttalburg is located on the [[New River Gorge National River|New River Gorge]] and was developed to house workers mining coal sold to the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]].  [[Henry Ford]] built a huge conveyor belt system to transport coal from the mine to the river and railway below, but abandoned it in 1928.

The town is included within the [[Nuttallburg Coal Mining Complex and Town Historic District]], part of [[New River Gorge National River]].<ref name="nrhpinv1">{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Nomination: Nuttallburg Coal Mining Complex and Town Historic District|url=http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/fayette/07000846.pdf |format=pdf|date=March 2005 |author=Rita Walsh|publisher=National Park Service|postscript=.}}</ref>
