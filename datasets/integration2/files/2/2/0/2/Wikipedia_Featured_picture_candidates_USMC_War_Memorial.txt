* '''Regretful Oppose''' I love the memorial, but the angle isn't that great (a head on view would be better), there is quite a bit of noise throughout the picture, and the flash lighting isn't as appealing as sunlight.

*This was considered before at [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/USMC War Memorial]]. Note the various other edits introduced during that process. [[User:Chick Bowen|Chick Bowen]] 17:00, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
*'''Oppose, and suggest speedy close''' There seemed to be a strong consensus to not promote this image last time, and it still suffers from unfixable problems with composition (the base being cut off) and lighting. [[User:Nick-D|Nick-D]] ([[User talk:Nick-D|talk]]) 07:24, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
**I wouldn't object to a speedy close, given that the image was pretty well discussed last time, including adjustments that could be made through editing. Having looked through the various images, I find most of them suffer from the sculpture's height, which causes an exaggerated perspective and a lot of sky. The best approach is probably [[:File:USMC War Memorial Sunset Parade 2008-07-08-2.jpg|this one]], from further back, though that is obviously too small. I haven't been there since I was a small child and am basing this on the photographs, but I get the sense there's a bit of a rise on the other side of the grassy area they use for military reviews. A photo from up there, with a longer lens, would work pretty well. This is a much-visited site, so I'd think we could get a decent picture at some point.
