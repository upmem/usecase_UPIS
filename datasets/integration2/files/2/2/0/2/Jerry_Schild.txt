'''Jerry Schild''' (September 1, 1954 – August 4, 2012) was a [[NASCAR]] driver from [[Houston]], Texas.

==Career==
Jerry Schild was the son of local race car veteran Charles Ray and younger brother of [[Larry Schild]]. Jerry was well known in the series because he had been racing since the age of 6. Starting from modest beginnings in [[go-kart]]s, he began to build a reputation as a no-nonsense racer, a trait that he continued to bring to the seat of the Jerry Schild Racing team.

After several more years of competition on the go-kart circuits, he stepped up to the challenges of the [[NASCAR Late Model Sportsman]] features at [[Meyer Speedway]]. It was 1972, Jerry was only 16 when he began driving full-time rookie for [[Rush Johnson]]. He placed 3rd in point standings with top-five finishes in almost every race that year. The following year he was 2nd in points, again finishing top five most of the season. He worked his way up on the circuit eventually gain sponsorship from legendary [[A. J. Foyt]], as well as [[Red Adair]], continuously proving his exceptional driving abilities throughout several seasons to follow, earning many trophies for his sponsors.

In 1974, Jerry made five Grand National appearances racing alongside such veterans as David Pearson, [[Benny Parsons]], [[Richard Petty]], [[Cale Yarborough]], Bobby & Donnie Allison, [[Buddy Baker]], [[Darrell Waltrip]], and Harry Grant. The [[1974 Southern 500|Darlington Southern 500]] in September, resulted in an 8th-place finish, the best ever for a first-time competitor on the track. [[Cale Yarborough]], winner of the race, was quoted as saying "a lot of veterans might do well to take driving lessons from teen-aged Jerry Schild."

More compelling{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} highlights of Schild's career include another trip down victory lane with first-place prize in the [[Texas Invitational Stock Car Classics]], [[Texas World Speedway]]. More notable{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} was his Busch competition at Daytona Speedway, qualifying 5th and finishing in 11th place.

Throughout the 1980s, Schild consistently raced hard on various other circuits including Midgets and Sprint cars ([[Texas Super Sprinters]]) on various dirt tracks in Texas. Afterward, he returned to asphalt, including another trip down Victory lane at the Lubri Lon Grand Prix at [[Texas World Speedway]] in the TIDA ([[Texas International Driver's Association]]). Schild competed in various Late Model Stock Car events in this decade.

In 2003, Schild won the Texas State Championship, racing in Houston, Corpus Christi, San Antonio and Kyle, Texas. In 2004, he was 2nd in state points with several wins. In 2005, he ran a limited schedule and placed 6th in state points. In 2006, Jerry ran the Houston Modified series at [[Houston Motorsports Park]] and was the track champion in modified.

Jerry continued to race at Houston Motorsports Park in the NASCAR WHELEN All American Series up until he was murdered in 2012.

He drove a d total of {{convert|1750.1|mi|km}} in the top level of American [[stock car racing]]; the equivalent of 1142 laps. While starting in 26th place on average, Schild always improved on that by finishing in 22nd place. His only "top ten" finish came at the [[1974 Southern 500]]. Schild's entire driving career was at the age of 19, which would be considered a "flash in the pan" compared to the lengthy careers of today's NASCAR drivers.<ref>[http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Jerry_Schild Career statistics of ''Jerry Schild''] at Racing Reference</ref>

That was her rock and her rock's gone. "In 2009, Jerry saved his sister's life by donating one of his kidneys to her.
