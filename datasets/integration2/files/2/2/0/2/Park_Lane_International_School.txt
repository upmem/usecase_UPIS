'''Park Lane International School''' is an independent international day school located in [[Prague]], the [[Czech Republic]]. The Park Lane student community consists of 500+ students, representing more than 40 nationalities. The home to foreign student ratio is 54% to 46%.  

The EYFS, Primary and Secondary campuses currently cater for children from Pre-Nursery (aged 2-3) to Year 12 (aged 16-17). Following its IB World School accreditation in February 2018, Park Lane has recently expanded to accommodate pupils (aged 16–18), who study the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme at the senior school branch at the Klarov branch of the Prague 1 campus.

Although classified as a British international school, because of its location in the Czech Republic, Park Lane also offers an intensive Czech programme for all pupils. This programme ensures that Park Lane’s students pass their annual Czech state examinations as required by the Czech law.

== History ==

Park Lane International School officially opened in September 2006. Within 7 years it had grown into a full-scale Primary school with 180 pupils on roll. In 2013, the Secondary school campus at Valdstejnska was opened. The senior school branch, located at Klarov, first welcomed students in the 2017/2018 academic year. The school caters for 550 students from the EYFS through to the Secondary school. 

== Locations ==

Park Lane International School opened its first campus at Prague 5 Bertramka accommodating children aged from 2 to 6 years. The Prague 5 Bertramka campus, being a home to the Early Years Foundation Stage, is located in a spacious villa with its own garden.

The School’s primary campus has its headquarters in a building called Norbertinum at Prague 6. Norbertinum, which originally served as a kindergarten, was built by the church in 1904. The school is located in [[Střešovice]], a quiet neighbourhood featuring many villas, some of which were designed in the functionalist style by renowned Czech architects. Another part of the Stresovice-Prague 6 campus, located within walking distance from Norbertov, is the Sibeliova branch, a spacious villa with a purposely designed garden that is a home to the Early Years Foundation Stage. 

The Prague 6 [[Střešovice]] campus accommodates children from Nursery to Year 5. Even though the Norbertov and Sibeliova sites at Prague 6 are located a short distance from the city centre, both are easily accessible by public transport with tram and bus stops nearby.
 
The Secondary school, which opened in September 2013, is situated in the historic district of [[Malá Strana]] in a palatial building situated directly alongside the walls of Prague Castle and extremely close to Malostranska metro station and a major tram stop which serves several different routes. Surrounded by its own walled gardens and terraces in a plot measuring 3000m2, the building - which was used as an embassy for several decades - is in exemplary condition having recently undergone a full refurbishment.

The latest addition to the Prague 1 campus, located a short walk away from the Prague 1 Valdstejnska building, is the Klarov branch, which caters to students in the final four years of secondary school and is a registered location for Cambridge IGCSE and IB Diploma examinations.

Although all campuses are situated close to public transport stops, younger children have the option of travelling to and from the school and between campuses using school buses.

== Curriculum ==

The school follows the National Curriculum of England and offers a British education to children from pre-nursery to university entrance, taught by UK qualified native speakers, plus British trained foreign teachers and local teachers.

Pupils at Park Lane International School prepare for KS2 National Tests and, at the secondary level, will sit for Cambridge [[IGCSE]] examinations, followed by the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme]] (IBDP), which is widely accepted by universities worldwide.

In order to ensure a smooth academic career transition, a Careers and University Advisor is available to assist all students at the IGCSE and IBDP levels. 

Modern Foreign languages at Park Lane are offered both within the curriculum provision as well as through the extracurricular activities. Students at Park Lane can choose among Spanish, French, German, and Russian languages. 

Art and Music education are an important part of Park Lane’s educational provision. The music department, in cooperation with the International School of Music and Fine Arts, offers a wide range of curriculum-based as well as extracurricular classes, both individual as well as group, such as bands and choir. Every year, the music department holds an annual music extravaganza called the Sound of Park Lane. And, from 2015, the Art department has hosted the Park Lane International Film Festival (PLIFF) targeted at students of other international schools in the Czech Republic and beyond.

== Scholarship ==

Park Lane International School offers an IB scholarship programme to all potential candidates. It holds two application rounds each year and applicants are chosen after undertaking a challenging selection process.
