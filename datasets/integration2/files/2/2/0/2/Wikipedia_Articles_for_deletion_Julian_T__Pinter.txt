Contested prod. Movie director with questionable [[WP:BIO|notability]]. The only reference is IMDB and Google News has nothing about him. <span style="background:#CC1010;color:#FFA0A0">'''&nbsp;Blanchardb'''&nbsp;</span>-<sup><span style="color:#A62428">[[User:Blanchardb|Me]]•[[User Talk:Blanchardb|MyEars]]•[[Special:Contributions/Blanchardb|MyMouth]]</span></sup>- timed 14:57, 11 December 2012 (UTC)

* '''Delete''', notability is very weak. As an aside, the article itself seems to be mistitled (appears to be "Pinder" as per [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2056034/ IMDB]). [[User:SMC|SMC]] ([[User talk:SMC|talk]]) 16:52, 11 December 2012 (UTC)

*Yes, I made a mistake with the director's last name. It should be "Pinder," not "Pinter." Thanks. --[[User:Splashen|Splashen]] ([[User talk:Splashen|talk]]) 18:40, 11 December 2012 (UTC)

* '''Keep.''' Move article to correct name and expand and [[WP:NRVE|source through what is available]]. While as a documentary filmmaker, his [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2056034/ career is short], his work HAS received the requisite coverage under [[WP:FILMMAKER]].

***Hmmm....? Cannot explain the mystery of a broken ''find sources'', but my own search results for "Julian T. Pinder" quickly brought me quite a few sources speaking about he and his arguably [[WP:NF|notable work]] ''Land''...

*Seems to me the article needs to be flipped. The two works he is credited as having produced" merely show him as an associate producer, a rather minor credit. But ''Land'' in particular generated a decent amount of coverage, especially for a social issue documentary. Seems to me what we have here is a notable Canadian documentary filmmaker who has also paid the bills with some production work.

**Agreed, and though busy on other things now, I am willing to undergo such [[WP:ATD|regular editing]] after a presumed keep. In the meantime, I have begun the framework on an associated article on that particular film. See [[User:MichaelQSchmidt/Land (2010 film)]].

*'''Keep''' Yes, I just did a basic rewrite. Refs need to be added and the article expanded, of course. The DocSpace interview is indeed vey illuminating, this guy was working with [[Jennifer Baichwal]] while in ''high school'' for freak's sake. Not bad. He's clearly a notable doc filmmaker, with his directorial debut doc premiering at [[Hot Docs]]. It's not the nominator's fault the article title was misspelled,  [[User:Shawn in Montreal|Shawn in Montreal]] ([[User talk:Shawn in Montreal|talk]]) 12:10, 14 December 2012 (UTC)
