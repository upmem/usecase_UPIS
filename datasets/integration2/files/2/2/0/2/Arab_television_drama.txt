==Egypt==

=== Ramadan and Egyptian TV Dramas ===
In Egypt, ''musalsalat'' are designed to air for the first time during [[Ramadan]], and to last for the entire month.<ref name=":0">Dawoud, A. (2013). Chapter 9: Egyptian Audiences of Musalsalat in the Eye of the Beholder. In R. Butsch & S. Livingstone, ''Meanings of Audiences: Comparative Discourses'' (pp. 123-134). London: Routledge.</ref> As a result, television stations wind up rerunning ''musalsalat'' throughout the year, as barely any other ''musalsalat'' are produced.<ref name=":0" /> As such, Egyptian TV Dramas play a major role in Egyptian society, in that it heavily shapes and influences the culture, by curating both religious and modern content.<ref name=":1">Keenan, K., & Yeni, S. (2003). Ramadan Advertising in Egypt: A Content Analysis With Elaboration on Select Items. ''Journal Of Media And Religion'', ''2''(2), 109-117. <nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15328415jmr0202_04</nowiki></ref> This mixture of conservative thinking with contemporary business approaches proves controversial to critics. On the one hand, the content of programs does not align with the religious tone of Ramadan. Critics argues that the [[commercialization]] of Ramadan turned the holy month into "a month of self-denial" – where audiences are not spiritually in touch with God – rather than a month of self-awareness and deep reflection.<ref name=":1" /> On the other hand, the commercialization of Ramadan and TV programming is seen to be a natural process as Egyptians are increasingly adopting more Westernized lifestyles due to Egypt's developing economy.<ref name=":1" /> Because the Ramadan lifestyle guarantees the penetration of a large audience, prominent advertisers produce specific campaigns to air for the first time, despite the doubled advertising rates during that period.<ref name=":1" /> Additionally, the ads are seen to promote consumption, which goes against the spirit of Ramadan: which is to share and to be charitable.<ref name=":1" /> The commercials usually provide unattainable or unrealistic dreams for the urban and rural poor.<ref name=":2">Abu-Lughod, L. (2008). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>

=== History of Egyptian TV Programming ===
Television programming has continuously shaped the Egyptian [[national identity]] and the role of audiences.<ref name=":2" /> In the 1960s and 1970s, Egyptian TV programming was largely tied to the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and developmentalist agenda of the government under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|President Nasser]].<ref name=":2" /> Beginning the 1990s, TV programming witnessed a shift from developmentalist values – including [[Social Welfare|social welfare]] and national progress – to [[Capitalism|capitalist]] values.<ref name=":2" /> The discourse of national development was challenged by [[globalization]] as the Egyptian government began to espouse [[privatization]] and market reform.<ref name=":2" /> Private corporations began to provide funds for the production of serials and advertisements, including but not limited to the salaries of stars, extravagant sets, props, and location shoots.<ref name=":2" /> Competition between brands was encouraged and thus, commercials began gaining larger time slots on television that that granted to serials.<ref name=":2" /> Instead of treating audiences as "citizens", Egyptian media began to treat audiences as "consumers".<ref name=":2" /> Today, there are two ways through which [[consumerism]] relates to Egyptian melodramas: the first being the fascination with and admiration of actors and actresses – referred to as "stars" by viewers; and the second being television commercials.<ref name=":2" /> In 2012, [[Egypt]]ian television channels had more than 50 soap operas on offer, for a combined production cost estimated at a record 1.18 billion [[Egyptian pounds]].<ref name="bbc-rsoab" />

=== Egyptian ''Musalsalat'': A Social Construction of Reality ===
Egyptian serials are well placed at the heart of Egyptian society, examining all areas of the society.<ref name=":3">Abou Zeid, D. (2016). The Portrayal of Happiness in Egyptian TV Series. ''Global Media Journal (Malaysian Edition)'', ''6''(1).</ref> They tackle prevalent social and political issues – such as [[corruption]] and [[oppression]] –, in a way that allows individuals and families to relate to the events or characters of the ''musalsal''.<ref name=":0" /> In their crafting of being relatable, but also distant, drama serials serve as a medium to spread information among and to educate the masses.<ref name=":4">Auter, P., Agnihotri, I., Red, M., Sharif, J., & Roy, F. (2010). Effects of Viewing Drama on Egyptian and American Youths' Perceptions of Family. ''Journal Of Middle East Media'', ''6''(1), 1-24.</ref> They allow for the construction of a multifaceted understanding of the current social reality.<ref name=":4" /> They invite the audience to evaluate current issues, from different viewpoints, as they can relate to certain aspects, while also being entertained, as the serials provide a certain distance between viewers and actors.<ref name=":4" /> That being said, television serials have a [[social responsibility]], especially in a developing country, to teach its viewers on the different ways one can achieve happiness.<ref name=":3" />

==== Common Themes ====
Egyptian soap operas usually follow a main character as he or she struggles to gain recognition and his or her position in society.<ref name=":3" /> As such, excessive consumption and desire for money at any cost are themes that appear in storylines, usually leading characters to engage in illegal and corrupt practices, such as bribery, embezzlement, and drug dealing.<ref name=":2" /> Storylines typically emphasize the vulnerability of the younger generation to obtaining financial security through marriage, engaging in illegal or demeaning work, or turning to drug dealing and addictive consumption.<ref name=":2" /> In these cases, serials serve as tools to teach Egyptian society of the financial burden the youth carries.<ref name=":2" /> Another representation in relation to money that has dominated in Egyptian cinema and television drama is marking the contrast between rich and poor, often portrayed as corrupt versus noble.<ref name=":2" /> Egyptian television programming provides a paradox between attempting to teach society of the realities of gaining money through immoral and illegal means, while constantly being exposed, and subjected to luxurious and extravagant lifestyles.<ref name=":2" />

==== International Recognition ====
In 15 March 2018, [[Netflix]] added the first Egyptian series Grand Hotel under the name "Secret of the Nile", with English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish subtitles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/44993/Netflix-releases-a-unique-compilation-of-films-and-series-for|title=Netflix releases a unique compilation of films and series for March|last=|first=|date=|work=Egypt Today|access-date=}}</ref> It is also the first Arabic series released on the online streaming service.<ref name=":5">{{Cite news|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/Egyptian-Mosalsal-netflix|title=This Egyptian Mosalsal just became the first Arabic series on Netflix|last=|first=|date=|work=Cairo Scene|access-date=}}</ref> Produced by Egypt's [[Capital Broadcasting Center|CBC]], the TV series is an Egyptian equivalent of the Spanish drama television series "[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]" and was aired during [[Ramadan|Ramadan 2016]] .<ref name=":5" />

[[Syria]]n soap operas took off in the 1990s, when satellite-television access increased across the Arab world, and were watched by tens of millions of people from Morocco to the Persian Gulf. As a consequence of the [[Syrian Civil War]], Syrian production companies have shelved new shows and viewers throughout the Arab world have called for a boycott of Syrian satellite channels. A tax break issued by the government has failed to revive the industry.<ref name=nyt-acow>{{cite web|title=Another Casualty of War: Soap Operas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/opinion/in-syria-the-soap-opera-is-a-casualty-of-war.html|work=New York Times|date=August 16, 2012}}</ref> In 2010, some 30 Syrian soaps were aired during Ramadan, some only in Syria, but most on pan-Arab satellite channels.<ref name=ft-ttss>{{cite web|title=Tough times for Syrian soap operas|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cdb99908-ae0a-11e0-a2ab-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2EksfWYBm|publisher=Financial Times|date=July 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Jordan==
[[Jordan]] produces a number of "Bedouin Soap Operas" that are filmed outdoors with authentic props.<ref>{{cite web|title=Artists concerned with decline in Jordan's Bedouin dramas|url=http://al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/meii/features/entertainment/2011/03/03/feature-03|publisher=Al-Shorfa|date=2011-03-03}}</ref> The actors use Bedouin-accented Arabic to make the story feel more authentic. These musalsalat have become popular in Saudi Arabia and Iraq.

In musalsalat that center around traditional village life during the time period just before World War II.  Oftentimes, these dramas are permeated by themes of tension between the traditional and modern ways of life with specific emphasis on the patriarchal systems and the role of women within them. Unique to this particular type of musalsal is the willingness of the shows' creators to confront sensitive issues such as [[honor killing]]. Another musalsal genre is that of the historical drama. Topics of these shows range from pre-Islamic poets to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Many of these are joint productions by Jordanian, Syrian, and Persian Gulf region television producers. According to a survey of Jordan's television viewers, 92.5% prefer watching Syrian dramas while 61.6% prefer Egyptian ones. This is compared to 26.6% who prefer watching Jordanian drama series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jordanian TV viewers prefer Syrian and Egyptian drama series over Jordanian ones|url=http://www.arabadvisors.com/Pressers/presser-190910.htm|publisher=Arab Advisors Group|date=September 19, 2010|access-date=December 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222022704/http://www.arabadvisors.com/Pressers/presser-190910.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While the aforementioned musalsalat target a broader, Arabic-speaking audience, certain programs target Jordanians specifically.  These shows tend to deal with social and political issues particular to present-day Amman. Acting in these programs, as well as Jordanian musalsalat in general, is often lauded as being superior to that of many Egyptian-produced soap operas.<ref>Shoup, John A. "Literature and Media."
