{{nihongo|'''Snow, Moon and Flowers'''|雪月花|setsu-getsu-ka or setsu gekka}} is a Japanese expression and theme in art and design originating from a [[Chinese poetry|poem]] by [[Tang dynasty]] poet [[Bai Juyi]]<ref>雪月花時最憶君: ''At the time of snow, moon and flowers, I think of you.''</ref>. It became popular in the late [[Edo period]]. It is a [[metonym]] for beautiful sceneries in the nature in Japanese.

==Introduction==
This threefold theme usually refers to the seasons of the year:<ref>The short hot summer is skipped.</ref> snow refers to winter, moon refers to autumn and flowers refers to spring. But one could also think it as representations of three whites: blue-white refers to winter, yellow-white refers to autumn and pink-white refers to spring.

[[Ukiyo-e]] artists liked to sell prints in series, sometimes even scrolls were painted to be hanged together. Artists liked to combine it with three women, three well known landscapes (moon always with reflecting water) etc.

"Snow, Moon and flowers" appear also as decoration on boxes, backside of traditional mirrors etc.
