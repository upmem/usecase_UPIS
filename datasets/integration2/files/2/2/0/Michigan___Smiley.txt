'''Michigan and Smiley''' are a [[Jamaica]]n reggae/dancehall duo consisting of Papa Michigan (born Anthony Fairclough) and General Smiley (born Erroll Bennett). They rose to popularity during the first wave of [[dancehall]] music in the late 1970s.

==Career==
The duo of Michigan (Anthony Fairclough) and Smiley recorded at [[Coxsone Dodd|Clement "Coxsone" Dodd]]'s [[Studio One (record label)|Studio One]] in Jamaica, pressing their first [[Record chart|number one]] [[hit single]], "Rub a Dub Style", which featured their call and response style vocals, overdubbed on the Studio One [[riddim]], "Vanity" (the instrumental alias given to [[Alton Ellis]]' Rocksteady classic, "I'm Just A Guy").<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae |year= 1998 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=0-7535-0242-9 }}</ref>  Their next single, perhaps a larger hit, "Nice Up the Dance" was a version of the quintessential [[Studio One (record label)|Studio 1]] rhythm, "Real Rock".  These singles, with four other tracks, also versions of Studio One rhythms, were released as their first [[album]], ''Nice Up the Dance''. The names of these two singles were quickly incorporated into the [[lexicon]] of [[dancehall]] phraseology. Their call and response style was likewise influential on the future developments of the music, blending together straightforward singing styles and [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]].  By 1982, they caught the attention of [[Henry "Junjo" Lawes]], who recorded their biggest hit, "Diseases" over the "Mad Mad" riddim. This track was featured on their second LP, ''Downpression''. They went on to cut an album for [[Channel One Studios|Channel One Records]], ''Step by Step''. The last of their hit records was "Sugar Daddy", pressed on [[RAS Records]], which featured yet another reworking of "Mad Mad".

Michigan & Smiley recorded a version of [[Suzanne Vega]]'s hit single "[[Tom's Diner]]" that is included on the compilation album ''[[Tom's_Diner#Remakes_and_samples|Tom's Album]]''. <ref>{{Citation|title=Tom's Album |medium=Album cover |publisher=A&M Records |year=1991 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref> The duo continue to record and make appearances at [[music festival|festivals]] and have both released solo recordings. Michigan is set to release the album ''DJ Legend'', to be preceded in September 2014 by an EP of the same name.<ref>Campbell-Livingston, Cecelia (2014) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/The-legendary-Michigan-returns_17566558#poll The Legendary Michigan returns]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 19 September 2014.
