===Discussion===


WikiProject Jesus.
The article on [[Jesus]] is currently under the auspices of several WikiProjects - including, not surprisingly,that for Christianity and a number of mainstream denominations. Surely such a figure, who had such a profound influence on world history, could become the subject of a WikiProject - after all, there is a discipline called [[Christology]]? The article on Jesus says that it is called Jesus, rather than Jesus Christ, and this would make sense for this WikiProject, as it could then oversee questions about how Jesus is seen in non-Christian faiths such as [[Islam]].
