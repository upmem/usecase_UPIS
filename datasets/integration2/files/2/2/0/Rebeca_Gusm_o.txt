'''Rebeca Gusmão''' (born August 24, 1984) is a former [[freestyle swimming|freestyle]] [[swimmer]] from [[Brazil]]. She won the bronze medal in the women's 4×100&nbsp;m freestyle relay at the [[Swimming at the 2003 Pan American Games|Pan American Games]] in [[Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic]]. She also participated at the [[Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympics]] and the [[2007 Pan American Games]].

Gusmão won the women's 50 and 100 freestyle events at the 2007 Pan Ams; however, all her results (times and placings) from those Games were later nullified due to a positive doping-control test. Her medals were also revoked.

==Doping sanction/banning==
There are 3 testing groups that are relevant to Rebeca Gusmão's doping sanctions:
*an in-competition test from May 25–26, 2006,
*an out-of-competition test on July 13, 2007, and
*the in-competition test'''s''' from the 2007 Pan American Games.

Basically, the 2006 test and the out-of-competition test were positive for testosterone; the in-competition tests showed signs of tampering.

On November 5, 2007, Rebeca Gusmão received a provisionally suspension by [[FINA]], the International Swimming Federation, for a positive out-of-competition doping control result for [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] taken on July 13, 2007. With this, she was temporarily barred from competition (effective November 2, 2007), until a hearing could be held before the FINA Doping Panel.<ref>[http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1159&Itemid=126 FINA Doping Panel Decision -- Rebeca Gusmão 2007-11-05].

On December 13, 2007, [[Pan American Sports Organisation|PASO]] declared Rebeca Gusmão guilty of doping with testosterone and revoked her [[2007 Pan American Games|XV Pan American Games]] medals. Her times from the 2007 Pan American Games were also nullified.

On May 16, 2008, the FINA Doping Panel declared Gusmão ineligible for 2 years (beginning November 2, 2007) for the out-of-competition result.<ref>[http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1159&Itemid=126 FINA Doping Panel Decision - Rebecca Gusmao (BRA) Friday, 16 May 2008].

On July 28, 2008, the FINA Doping Panel declared Gusmão ineligible for 2 years (beginning July 17, 2008) for the May 2006 test which contained testosterone. With this decision, all results from May 25, 2006 forward were nullified.<ref>[http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=38&Itemid=126 FINA Doping Panel Decision - Rebecca Gusmao (BRA) Monday, 28 July 2008].

Then September 3, 2008, the FINA Doping Panel banned Gusmão for life ("ineligible for lifetime") due to tampering.<ref>[http://www.fina.org/project/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1648&Itemid=126 FINA Doping Panel Decision - Rebecca Gusmao (BRA)]; posted on the FINA website on 2008-09-03.
