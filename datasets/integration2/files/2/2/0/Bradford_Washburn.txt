'''Henry Bradford Washburn, Jr.''' (June 7, 1910 – January 10, 2007) was an American explorer, [[mountaineering|mountaineer]], [[photography|photographer]], and [[cartography|cartographer]]. He established the [[Boston Museum of Science]], served as its director from 1939–1980, and from 1985 until his death served as its Honorary Director (a lifetime appointment). Bradford married [[Barbara Washburn|Barbara Polk]] in 1940, they honeymooned in [[Alaska]] making the first ascent of Mount Bertha together.<ref name=saga>{{cite book|last1=Borneman|first1=Walter R.|title=Alaska : saga of a bold land|date=2003|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-06-050306-8|pages=320–325|edition=1st}}</ref>

Washburn is especially noted for exploits in four areas. 
*He was one of the leading American mountaineers in the 1920s through the 1950s, putting up first ascents and new routes on many major [[Alaska]]n peaks, often with his wife, [[Barbara Washburn]], one of the pioneers among female mountaineers and the first woman to summit [[Denali]] (Mount McKinley).<ref>''The Accidental Adventurer: Memoir of the First Woman to Climb Mt. McKinley'' by Barbara Washburn, [[Lew Freedman]] and Bradford Washburn, Epicenter Press, May 2001.</ref>
*He pioneered the use of [[aerial photography]] in the analysis of mountains and in planning mountaineering expeditions. His thousands of striking black-and-white photos, mostly of Alaskan peaks and glaciers, are known for their wealth of informative detail and their artistry. They are the reference standard for route photos of Alaskan climbs.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
*He was responsible for creating maps of various mountain ranges, including [[Denali]], [[Mount Everest]], and the [[Presidential Range]] in [[New Hampshire]].<ref>''The Last of His Kind: The Life and Adventures of Bradford Washburn, America's Boldest Mountaineer'' by [[David Roberts (climber)|David Roberts]], [[William Morrow Publishers]], June 2009.</ref>
*His stewardship of the [[Boston Museum of Science]].<ref>''The Last of His Kind: The Life and Adventures of Bradford Washburn, America's Boldest Mountaineer'' by David Roberts, William Morrow Publishers, June 2009.</ref>

Several of these achievements – e.g. the Everest map and subsequent further work on the elevation and geology of Everest – were carried out when Washburn was in his 70s and 80s.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Biography==
Washburn was born on June 7, 1910, in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to a [[Boston Brahmin]] family whose roots trace back to ''[[Mayflower]]'' passenger Elder [[William Brewster (pilgrim)|William Brewster]].  Brewster was the Pilgrim colonist leader and a spiritual elder of the [[Plymouth Colony]]. His father, the Very Rev. Henry Bradford Washburn, Sr. an avid outdoorsman, was dean of the [[Episcopal Theological School]] in Cambridge and Edith Buckingham Hall. His younger brother was [[Sherwood Washburn|Sherwood Larned Washburn]], nicknamed  "Sherry", who was a [[biological anthropology|physical anthropologist]] and pioneer in the field of [[primatology]].

Washburn was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1956.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter W|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterW.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> He received an undergraduate degree from [[Harvard University]], where he was a member of the Harvard Mountaineering Club. He returned to Harvard to earn a master's degree in [[geology]] and [[geography]] in 1960.

Washburn was an avid pilot and made his first solo flight in a [[Fleet biplane]] at [[Boeing Field]] in [[Seattle]] in 1934.  He earned his private flying license at [[Roosevelt Field]] on [[Long Island]] later that year.

Washburn embarked on a notable expedition in 1937 to <span style="white-space:nowrap">17,147&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(5,226&nbsp;m)</span> [[Mount Lucania]] in the [[Yukon]].  To do this he and climbing partner [[Robert Bates (mountaineer)|Robert Bates]] had to reach Walsh Glacier, <span style="white-space:nowrap">8,750&nbsp;ft&nbsp;(2,670&nbsp;m)</span>  above sea level.  He called upon [[Robert Campbell Reeve|Bob Reeve]], a famous Alaskan [[bush pilot]], who later replied by cable to Washburn, "Anywhere you'll ride, I'll fly".<ref name="saga" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Debbie|title=A Pioneer Visit: Mard Murie and the Arctic Refuge|journal=Alaska Geographic|date=1993|volume=20|issue=3|page=45}}</ref> The ski-equipped [[Fairchild F-51]] made several trips to the landing site on the glacier without event in May, but on landing with Washburn and Bates in June, the plane sank into unseasonal slush.  Washburn, Bates and Reeve pressed hard for five days to get the airplane out and Reeve was eventually able to get the airplane airborne with all excess weight removed and the assistance of a smooth icefall with a steep drop.  Washburn and Bates continued on foot to make the first ascent of Lucania, and after an epic descent and journey to civilization,<ref name="venables">{{cite book | first = Stephen | last = Venables | authorlink = Stephen Venables | title = Voices from the Mountains | location = Pleasantville, NY | publisher = Reader's Digest | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-7621-0810-X | oclc = 68417016 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/voicesfrommounta00step/page/40 40–43] | url = https://archive.org/details/voicesfrommounta00step/page/40 }}</ref> they hiked over 150 miles through the wilderness to safety in the small town of [[Burwash Landing]].<ref>[http://www.adn.com/outdoors/story/9362435p-9276110c.html Anchorage Daily News.
