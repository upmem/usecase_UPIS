*'''Redirect to [[Vlad Yudin]]'''. If/when this releases and gains more coverage, we can always unredirect this but at this point in time it'd just [[WP:TOOSOON]] for an entry. We don't have enough coverage to really merit an article at this point in time.

* '''Redirect''' to [[Vlad Yudin]].  I noticed a few trivial mentions, all of which seem to already be in the article, but I agree that it seems a bit too soon.  Could also be userfied or moved to draft space.  Surprisingly, there's no coverage at all in the usual places ([[Bloody Disgusting]], [[Dread Central]], [[Twitch Film]], etc).

* '''Redirect''' to [[Vlad Yudin]] or possibly [[The Vladar Company]] based on a lack of substantial coverage at this time on the film. [[User:I JethroBT|<font color="green" face="Candara"><b>I, JethroBT</b></font>]][[User talk:I JethroBT| <sup>drop me a line</sup>]] 02:24, 31 October 2014 (UTC)
