'''José María Morelos''' is the municipal seat and largest city in [[José María Morelos Municipality]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Quintana Roo]]. According to the 2010 census, the city's population was 11,750 persons.<ref>[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 |date=2013-05-02 }}</ref>

José María Morelos was established in the 19th century with the purpose of exporting wood and [[chicle]]. It was originally called Kilómetro 50, since it was {{Convert|50|km}} from [[Peto Municipality|Peto]]. When Quintana Roo became a state in 1974, the place was renamed after the revolutionary rebel leader [[José María Morelos]], and it became the seat of the namesake municipality.
