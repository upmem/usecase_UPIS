==Life and career==
Nicklas was born in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which was then in [[County Durham]].<ref name=Hugman/> He played as a [[wing half]] before what the ''[[Sunderland Echo]]'' described as a promising career was interrupted by [[National Service]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].<ref name=Echo>{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19511102/167/0013 |title=Trevor Ford takes over again |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |date=2 November 1951 |page=13 |url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> He began playing for [[Wearside Football League|Wearside League]] club [[Silksworth Colliery Welfare F.C.|Silksworth Colliery Welfare]] at the start of the 1950–51 season,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000640/19500825/155/0012 |title=Dawdon ring changes |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |date=25 August 1950 |page=12 |url-access=subscription |via=British Newspaper Archive}}</ref> but soon went on trial with [[Football League Second Division]] club [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]], and turned professional with that club in December 1950.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19501213/041/0006 |title=City's young wing-half |newspaper=Daily Mail |location=Hull |date=13 December 1950 |page=6 |url-access=subscription |via=British Newspaper Archive}}</ref>

He made his first-team debut a year later, on 27 October 1951, playing in the unaccustomed position of [[centre forward]]; although he had played a few reserve matches in that position, the ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' doubted that "a home match against a team playing as strongly as [[Rotherham United]] are just now is the ideal occasion" for a youngster's debut.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19511027/387/0011 |title=More bold moves by team selectors |first=Richard |last=Ulyatt |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=27 October 1951 |page=11 |url-access=subscription |via=British Newspaper Archive}}</ref> Rotherham took a three-goal lead, but Hull came back to draw, and Nicklas scored their opener: he "had his faults, but dash, speed and courage were not among them. He harassed [the goalkeeper] into a goal offering and accepted it with glee".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19511029/082/0003 |title=Great day for the newcomers |newspaper=Yorkshire Post |date=29 October 1951 |page=3 |url-access=subscription |via=British Newspaper Archive}}</ref> He was known for his pace, having competed in professional sprint races.<ref name=Echo/> Nicklas played five more matches for Hull, the last of which was on 22 March 1952.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tigerbase.hullcity.com/tigers-players.php |title=Players |website=TigerBase |publisher=Matt Wales |accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Nicklas stayed with the club until the end of the following season, when he moved on to [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]].<ref name=Hugman/> He scored six goals from seventeen league matches for Darlington,<ref name=Hugman/> and spent the [[1954–55 Southern Football League|1954–55 season]] with [[Headington United]] in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], scoring four goals from fourteen matches in all competitions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rageonline.co.uk/mainpage/player/570/ |title=Charlie Nicklas |website=Rage Online |accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref>

Nicklas is the nephew of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] player [[Barney Travers]].<ref name=Echo/>
