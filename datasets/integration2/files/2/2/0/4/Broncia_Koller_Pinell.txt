'''Broncia Koller-Pinell''' (25 February 1863, [[Sanok]] - 26 April 1934, [[Oberwaltersdorf]]) was an Austrian [[Expressionist]] painter who specialized in portraits and [[still-life]]s.

== Life ==
She was born as '''Bronisława Pineles''' to a Jewish family in what is now Poland. Her father Saul Pineles (1834, [[Tysmenytsia]] – 1903, Vienna) was a designer of military fortifications.<ref name="J">[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/koller-pinell-broncia Jewish Women's Archive:] Biography by Birgit Ben Eli</ref> In 1870, they moved to Vienna to start a manufacturing business (where they changed the family name to "Pinell") and she took private art lessons with [[Alois Delug]].<ref name="O">{{ÖBL|4|87|88|Koller Bronislawa (Bronia)|Wacha}}</ref> In 1885, she had her first public exhibition. For the next five years, she studied in Munich at the "Damenakademie" of the Munich Artists' Association in the studios of [[Ludwig von Herterich]].<ref name="J" /> This was followed by exhibitions at the [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], in Munich and in Leipzig.<ref name="O" /> Koller-Pinell [[List of women artists exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition| exhibited]] her work at [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|The Woman's Building]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, Illinois.<ref name="Nichols">{{cite web |last1=Nichols |first1=K.

In 1896, against her family's wishes, she married the electro-physicist Dr.{{ill|Hugo Koller|de}} (1867-1949), who was a Catholic. Their children were raised as Christians, but she never converted.<ref name="J" /> At first, they lived in [[Salzburg]] and [[Nuremberg]], but returned to Vienna in 1902. Shortly after, she was accepted as a member of the [[Vienna Secession]].<ref name="O" /> In 1904, she inherited a house in Oberwaltersdorf. The family soon moved there, and she had it decorated by [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Koloman Moser]], associates from the Secession. Shortly after, she set up a salon<ref name="L">[http://geschichte.landesmuseum.net/index.asp?contenturl=http://geschichte.landesmuseum.net/personen/personendetail.asp___id=396269123 Niederösterreichisches Landesmuseum]: Brief biography</ref> that was frequented by [[Egon Schiele]], [[Anton Faistauer]] and [[Albert Paris Gütersloh]], among others.

Her son, Rupert (1896–1976), became a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]] and was briefly married to [[Anna Mahler]]. Her daughter Silvia (1898–1963) was also a painter.

Her work was included in the 2019 exhibition ''City Of Women: Female artists in Vienna from 1900 to 1938'' at the [[Österreichische Galerie Belvedere]].<ref name="Belvedere">{{cite web |title=City of Women |url=https://www.belvedere.at/en/city-women-0 |website=Belvedere Museum Vienna |accessdate=26 June 2020}}</ref>
