Although the club avoided public controversy by downplaying  involvement in "radical" causes such as the [[suffrage movement]], its members were active in a wide range of reforms.<ref name="Martinez p. 144" />  

The New Century Club was declared in ''Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy'' (2000) to be "an influential early  manifestation of the [[woman's club movement]] that swept through the country at the turn of the century. This movement brought thousands into associations where they met other ambitious, energetic women, developed organizational and leadership skills, and articulated a belief in social welfare and urban improvement that anticipated much Progressive Era social reform."<ref name="Martinez p. 144" /> It served as a support for professional women until individual, profession based organizations for women, such as [[The Plastic Club]] for artists and the Women's Homeopathic Medical Club, were founded starting in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Katharine Martinez|author2=Page Talbott|author3=Elizabeth Johns|title=Philadelphia's Cultural Landscape: The Sartain Family Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4phvm-bqDMC&pg=PA144|year=2000|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-791-9|pages=144–145}}</ref>

===New Century Guild===
In 1882, [[Eliza Sproat Turner]] and other members formed a committee for working women named the [[New Century Guild]]. Its purpose was to provide education and opportunities for working women to learn a vocation. Soon after the Guild became a separate organization and it needed its own building by 1892 to support programs and classes. The New Century Trust was formed in 1893 to facilitate funding for its first building.<ref name="Hidden City" />

===Locations===
The club moved to a larger place at 1520 Chestnut Street in the Baker Building for the 400 member organization and began plans for an even larger place at 124 Twelfth Street. Architect [[Minerva Parker Nichols]] designed a club house of [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance architecture]], of Indiana limestone and Pompeiian brick at and estimated cost of $80,000. The building had parlors, committee rooms, a library, and a six hundred person capacity drawing room. [[Gabrielle D. Clements]] created murals symbolizing Charity, Labor, Science and Art. The effort was led by the club's president, Mrs. Henry C. Townsend.<ref name="Commerce 1894" />
