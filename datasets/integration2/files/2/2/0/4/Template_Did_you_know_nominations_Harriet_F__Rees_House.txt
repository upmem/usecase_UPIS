* ... that the '''[[Harriet F. Rees House]]''' ''(pictured in 2010)'' in [[Chicago]] was recently moved one block north to make room for a basketball stadium and 1,200-room hotel?

:* ''Comment'': Scheduled for the first week of November, so the tense may have to change if this falls into the backlog
<small>Created by [[User:Teemu08|Teemu08]] ([[User talk:Teemu08|talk]]). Self nominated at 19:37, 16 October 2014 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Good to go. Well written article. Length, newness, hook interest, verified. No plagiarism detected. One suggestion, the pdf reference from <nowiki>http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/137348.pdf</nowiki> contains a lot of information regarding the interesting architecture of the building. It would be nice if some of those details were included in the article.

::*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] I agree with Dr.K., and I don't think this article about a building is ready for the main page without a section on its architecture. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 20:01, 22 October 2014 (UTC)
:::*I would certainly like to one day, but as far as [[Wikipedia:Did_you_know#What_DYK_is_not|DYK criteria]] are concerned, this is not an actionable oppose. We now know the [http://www.nwherald.com/2014/11/08/chicago-house-could-be-heaviest-ever-moved/ayuwjdn/ date] of the move. [[User:Teemu08|Teemu08]] ([[User talk:Teemu08|talk]]) 17:20, 9 November 2014 (UTC)
::::*Per [[Wikipedia:Did you know/Supplementary guidelines#Other supplementary rules for the article|Rule D7]], "Articles that fail to deal adequately with the topic are also likely to be rejected". Two editors have agreed that more needs to be said about the architecture. I'm sure you can find at least a paragraph of information in the NRHP sources. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 21:48, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
:::::*I agree that for the purposes of DYK, the article should say why the house is important enough to be moved. I'd propose mentioning its landmark status by the [[Commission on Chicago Landmarks]][http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-rees-landmark-move-met-20141107-story.html], as well as its being the last mansion remaining on South Prairie Avenue since 2002[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2832164/Historic-126-year-old-Chicago-mansion-weighing-1-000-tons-moved-600-feet-block-course-two-days.html#ixzz3L3RBhEpA]. A full-paragraph on it's architecture would be more than I would expect for this DYK, though is certainly desirable long-term.—[[User:Bagumba|Bagumba]] ([[User talk:Bagumba|talk]]) 19:49, 5 December 2014 (UTC)

::::::*[[User:Teemu08|Teemu08]], consensus is that some architectural information is needed for this nomination to receive approval. [[WP:DYKSG#D7]] has been cited from the DYK criteria. Please let us know whether you intend to address this topic or not; I don't imagine it would take you that long to write up the information requested. Thanks. [[User:BlueMoonset|BlueMoonset]] ([[User talk:BlueMoonset|talk]]) 17:21, 9 December 2014 (UTC)
:::::::*{{ping|User:BlueMoonset}} {{ping|User:Bagumba}} {{ping|User:Yoninah}} A section describing the architecture of the building has been added. [[User:Teemu08|Teemu08]] ([[User talk:Teemu08|talk]]) 17:20, 16 December 2014 (UTC)
::::::::*[[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] Thank you, [[User:Teemu08|Teemu08]], for adding the Architecture section. New material is neutrally written and does not show close paraphrasing. I tweaked the hook based on the source &ndash; the whole development is an entertainment complex that ''includes'' the basketball stadium and hotel. Image is freely-licensed. QPQ done. Original review by Dr. K. still holds. Good to go. [[User:Yoninah|Yoninah]] ([[User talk:Yoninah|talk]]) 23:10, 16 December 2014 (UTC)
