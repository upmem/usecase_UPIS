{{Nihongo|'''''Shimoneta: A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Doesn't Exist'''''|下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界|Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai}}, officially abbreviated as {{nihongo|'''''Shimoseka'''''|下セカ}} in Japan, is a Japanese [[light novel]] series written by Hirotaka Akagi and illustrated by Eito Shimotsuki. [[Shogakukan]] has published eleven volumes since February 2016 under their [[Gagaga Bunko]] imprint. A manga adaptation titled {{Nihongo|''Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai: Man**-hen{{efn|In Japanese, [[O mark]] often represents hidden characters.}}''|下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界 マン●篇}} with art by Yuzuki N' began serialization in [[Mag Garden]]'s [[shōnen manga|''shōnen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Monthly Comic Blade]]'' in March 2014. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[J.C.Staff]] aired from July 4 to September 19, 2015. {{nihongo|''Shimoneta''|[[:ja:下ネタ|下ネタ]]}} is a Japanese word for "[[vulgar slang]]", "dirty joke," "blue joke," or "erotic topic."

==Plot==
In the [[dystopian]] future of 2030, the Japanese government is cracking down on any perceived immoral activity from using risqué language to distributing lewd materials in the country, to the point where all citizens are forced to wear high-tech devices called Peace Makers (PM) at all times that analyze every spoken word and hand motions for any action that could break the law. A new high school student named Tanukichi Okuma enters the country's leading elite "public morals school" to reunite with his crush and student council president, Anna Nishikinomiya. However, Tanukichi quickly finds himself entwined with the perverted terrorist "Blue Snow" ("Tundra's Blue" in some translations) when she kidnaps and forces him to join her organization, "SOX", in creating and spreading pornographic material across the city as a form of protest against the regulations.

:The protagonist of the story, Tanukichi is the son of an infamous dirty joke terrorist named Zenjuro, who was arrested by the Japanese moral authorities years ago after trying to spread condoms around the [[National Diet Building|Diet]] building in defiance of the moral laws. He graduated from a public intermediate school with the "lowest morals score" according to his classmates. He finds himself constantly torn between keeping the secret of Ayame's [[alter-ego]] as a lewd terrorist and turning her in to the authorities to win Anna's favor.

;{{nihongo|Ayame Kajou|華城 綾女|Kajō Ayame|extra2= / }} {{nihongo|Blue Snow|雪原の青|Setsugen no Ao|lit. "Blue of the Snowfield"}}
:{{voiced by|[[Shizuka Ishigami]]<ref name="Japanese cast 1"/>|[[Jamie Marchi]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:The vice-president of the student council and daughter of a disgraced former Diet member who unsuccessfully fought against the public morality laws. Ayame secretly acts outside of school as the perverted terrorist "Blue Snow," wearing panties over her face, spreading semi-pornographic leaflets, and shouting dirty jokes in defiance of the Japanese moral authorities. After kidnapping Tanukichi, she decides to form the group SOX with him and expand her activities to include the school and beyond. Her father taught her a code she can use on her mobile phone that disables the collars and PMs she wears for three minutes per day allowing her to freely say or do any lewd things during the time.

;{{nihongo|Anna Nishikinomiya|アンナ・錦ノ宮|Anna Nishikinomiya<!-- not "Nishikinomiya Anna" -->}}
:{{voiced by|[[Miyu Matsuki]]<ref name="Japanese cast 1"/>|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:Student council president and Tanukichi's childhood crush who has tasked him with hunting down Blue Snow before she can endanger the morals of the school. After being accidentally kissed by Tanukichi, she develops an obsessive yandere-like love for him. However, due to lack of knowledge on "immoral" subjects, she ends up expressing her love in extreme ways. She exhibits extreme amounts of superhuman strength, speed and dexterity, especially when angered or motivated.

;{{nihongo|Otome Saotome|早乙女 乙女|Saotome Otome}}
:{{voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]<ref name="Japanese cast 1"/>|[[Brittney Karbowski]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:An artistic prodigy whose paintings have won awards and are even displayed throughout the school, though she seems bored by the attention. After inadvertently discovering Tanukichi changing out of a Blue Snow costume, she blackmails him into being her "pet" for a while, and later joins SOX in order to learn how to draw explicit artwork after being educated on the subject by Ayame. Because her PM is able to detect any lewd movement her hands make, she instead taught herself to draw by holding tools with her mouth to avoid its sensor.

;{{nihongo|Hyouka Fuwa|不破 氷菓|Fuwa Hyōka}}
:{{voiced by|[[Saori Gotō]]<ref name="Japanese cast 1"/>|Mikaela Krantz<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:A budding scientist and classmate of Tanukichi who is obsessed with solving the mystery behind how babies are truly conceived, as the Japanese moral authorities have censored everything pertaining to [[sex education]] beyond vague generalities. She even went so far as to constantly visit [[gynecology]] clinics and hospitals in order to learn more until she was banned from visiting them. Often collects insects to study their reproductive habits. She has a very sharp sense of observation. Though not officially a member of SOX, she helps them out from time to time because she is aware (to some degree) of the identities of its members.

;{{nihongo|Raiki Gouriki|轟力 雷樹|Gōriki Raiki}}
:{{voiced by|[[Kenta Miyake]]<ref name="Japanese cast 2"/>|[[David Wald]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:Treasurer of the student council with a posture and demeanor similar to that of a gorilla, though he hates bananas. He initially distrusted Tanukichi upon learning that he is Zenjuro's son, but later comes to respect him and care for his well-being after Tanukichi saved Anna from stalkers that attacked which left him hospitalized.

;{{nihongo|Kosuri Onigashira|鬼頭 鼓修理|Onigashira Kosuri}}

:The daughter of Keisuke and a fangirl of SOX who carries multiple weapons (such as [[air guns]] and [[Taser|electric stuns]]) with her and uses tactics she learned from romantic and shōjo manga to manipulate people, even her allies. Ayame lets her join in partly because her hairstyle looks similar to the tip of a penis.

:{{voiced by|[[Sayaka Ohara]]<ref name="Full Cast"/>|[[Lydia Mackay]]<ref name="Full Cast"/>}}

;{{nihongo|Oboro Tsukimigusa|月見草 朧|Tsukimigusa Oboro}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sumire Uesaka]]<ref name="Japanese cast 2"/>|Megan Vander Pluym<ref name="Full Cast"/>}}
:A seemingly female school prefect trained by Matsukage to adhere to a strict moral code that mostly revolves around protecting Anna from all potentially immoral influences, including mundane items like basketball hoops and toilet paper rolls. Oboro even has this codified under "Five Provisions," which includes the caveat that Oboro cannot interfere if Anna herself exhibits lewd behavior or desires. Oboro is surprisingly quick to change position on what is considered "illegal" material when a student protests strongly enough.

;{{nihongo|Keisuke Onigashira|鬼頭 慶介|Onigashira Keisuke}}
:Father of Kosuri; ero-terrorist who made deals with the moral authorities, angering the other terrorist groups around Japan, as well as his own daughter.

:{{voiced by|[[Ken Narita]]<ref name="Full Cast"/>|[[Anthony Bowling]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:Ero-terrorist who wraps himself in panties and is obsessed with underwear, having his own concepts of what is considered the best type of underwear. A "high-class pervert" who leads the group "Gathered Fabric" to steal all kinds of undergarments across Japan, he ends up clashing against SOX because Ayame believes him to be ruining the group's reputation by performing terrorist acts such as [[Carjacking|hijacking]] public transportation under the claim that Gathered Fabric is an ally of SOX.

;{{nihongo|Base Black|手の黒|Tehen no Kuro|lit. "Black Hand"}}
:{{voiced by|[[Sho Hayami]]<ref name="Full Cast"/>|[[Christopher R. Sabat]]<ref name="ENVoiceCast"/>}}
:An ero-terrorist who appears in the anime's last episode. He personally knew and worked alongside Zenjuro and planned to unlock a secret vault filled with erotic treasures using an artefact that was passed down to Tanukichi. He gathered the main cast to a resort via false invitations and challenged them to a duel for the artifact through Yakyuken.

;{{nihongo|Binkan|びんかんちゃん|}}
:{{voiced by|[[Yui Ogura]]<ref name="Japanese cast 2"/>}}
:An anime original character. Binkan is just an innocent bystander who is often nearby whenever SOX performs another act of ero-terrorism, staring at their latest handiwork. She is hardly acknowledged by the main characters until the final episode where it is shown that she is a prefect in training under the leadership of Oboro. Binkan's real name is never mentioned; her nickname roughly translates to "little sensitive (girl)."

;{{nihongo|Nadeshiko Kajou|華城 撫子|Kajō Nadeshiko}}

:An old childhood friend of Tanukichi and member of a rural farmer family.

After trying to defuse a tense situation, he finds himself about to be arrested by the Decency Squad when the infamous perverted terrorist Blue Snow appears, allowing Tanukichi escapes in the confusion. Later at school, Tanukichi's troubles continue as a classmate demands he answer how babies are made. The student council then brings him in to ask that he hunt down Blue Snow. Later that day, he heads to a quiet cafe with vice-president Ayame Kajou, who reveals she is actually Blue Snow. After being threatened into joining her crusade, Tanukichi helps her execute a plan at school during a student assembly, first spreading more perverted leaflets around the packed gym and then tricking the teachers into running outside while Ayame plays a video of two flies mating while she adds her own sound effects. Meanwhile, Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and starts drawing a giant asterisk sign on the track with a line painting machine. The entire school, including Tanukichi, finds themselves having trouble dealing with the weird new feelings brought on by this act.

Anna even hangs one such picture in the student council room, unaware of the double-meaning behind it until Tanukichi points it out. Tanukichi crushes on Anna again, but Ayame quietly warns him not to pursue her, as she can be frightening when angry, and that Anna's parents were responsible for the current and potential-future morals laws that have a stranglehold on Japan. Later, Ayame decides to hatch another plot at school during physical exams for the freshmen students. Ayame distracts Anna and Gouriki while Tanukichi disguises himself as Blue Snow and attempts to teach some students dirty words by sight. However, Anna catches the disguised Tanukichi, cornering him until Ayame appears as the real Blue Snow with the captured urine samples of the freshmen boys. As Anna and Gouriki race after her, Tanukichi takes off his Blue Snow disguise, unaware that an artistic student spotted him from a nearby roof.

However, her plans are sidelined when Tanukichi is targeted by a stalker and Anna's mother, Sophia, shows up to the school in person to get the students to support her new legislation. Running low on options, Ayame decides to have Tanukichi confront his stalker. However, the stalker turns out to be Anna, who restrains and attempts to rape Tanukichi. After Ayame accidentally interrupts them, Anna flees. Later that night, Hyouka confronts Anna in the lobby of her apartment, asking why her science lab was sterilized without asking.

On Sunday, the day of the "X Prohibition Law" signature drive, Sophia plans to greet the students of her daughter's academy in person and Ayame plans to quixotically storm the forest against a large force of the Decency Squad. Surprisingly, the students all show up at the forest, as Hyouka picked up Tanukichi's material and quietly spread copies around school herself. Just then, Anna shows up in person, chasing down a disguised Ayame. Ayame tosses Tanukichi down into the forest, where he finds the porn stash in a suggestively-shaped cave. However, when he hears Ayame being strangled by Anna, he decides to save her. Anna can't understand why the new terrorist gives her similar feelings to Tanukichi.
