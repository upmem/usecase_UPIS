==Background and composition==
Disney asked the band to write and perform the song for the film's sequence in which the ''[[Big Hero 6 (comics)|Big Hero 6]]'' team is transformed from a group of super smart individuals to a band of high-tech heroes. "We went over to Disney and met with the directors," bassist [[Pete Wentz]] recalled. "They explained the story to us. It was insane how much it lined up with the way our band saw the world."<ref name="Wentz">{{cite web |url=http://petewentz.com/post/99972018630/ill-be-the-guard-dog-of-all-your-fever-dreams |title=ill be the guard dog of all your fever dreams |publisher=PeteWentz.com |date=October 14, 2014 |accessdate=October 25, 2014 |author=Wentz, Pete |authorlink=Pete Wentz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161014052832/http://petewentz.com/post/99972018630/ill-be-the-guard-dog-of-all-your-fever-dreams |archive-date=October 14, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Wentz later stated, "Disney asked the band to come in and talk to the directors so we did that.... and we discussed the scene and what our song would attempt to do. Then we went home and wrote and sent it to them- it was a back and forth from there. It was interesting to be a part of because our song was just a small part of a bigger thing and the challenge to just be a part of the fabric. It was a really cool experience."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wentz|first1=Pete|title=Fall Out Boy on Tumblr - "little-starl0rd asked: Did Disney ask you to write a song for Big Hero 6 or did you write it first and they ask to use it?

Vocalist [[Patrick Stump]] said that the song's title was inspired by "the idea of this kid stepping up on behalf of his brother. Your victories aren't exclusively yours, so the fact that all of these people are coming together to help him get to the finish line is really exciting."<ref name="prnewsire">{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walt-disney-records-big-hero-6-soundtrack-features-original-song-immortals-from-fall-out-boy-and-score-by-henry-jackman-279194941.html |title=Walt Disney Records' Big Hero 6 Soundtrack Features Original Song 'Immortals' From Fall Out Boy And Score By Henry Jackman |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}</ref> Wentz further elaborated: "They're testing out their new super suits for the first time in the scene. Some of it works—some of it doesn't. You get the sense that they're stepping into a bigger role. The story's in the DNA of Fall Out Boy. It is an authentic story and it's who our band is—we've always identified with the underdog."<ref name="prnewsire"/>

On December 15, when the band's upcoming ''[[American Beauty/American Psycho]]'' (2015) album was made available for preorder, "Immortals" was revealed to also be included as track 10. On January 12, 2015, the six yet-unreleased songs from the album, including "Immortals" were made available for streaming on [[YouTube]]. The band quipped, "according to [[Baymax]] this is his favorite song on the record".<ref>[http://falloutboy.com/post/108016850302/according-to-baymax-this-is-his-favorite-song-on according to baymax this is his favorite song on the record] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115095627/http://falloutboy.com/post/108016850302/according-to-baymax-this-is-his-favorite-song-on |date=2015-01-15 }} falloutboy.com.
