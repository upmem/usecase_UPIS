'''''Ashanti''''' (also called '''''Ashanti, Land of No Mercy''''') is a 1979 action [[adventure film]] directed by [[Richard Fleischer]] and starring [[Michael Caine]], [[Peter Ustinov]], [[Kabir Bedi]], [[Beverly Johnson]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Rex Harrison]], and [[William Holden]]. It is based on the 1977 novel ''Ébano'' by [[Alberto Vázquez-Figueroa]], with a screenplay written by [[Stephen Geller]] and an uncredited [[George MacDonald Fraser]]. The story is set against the background of modern-day [[Slavery in modern Africa|slave trading]], with a man who determinedly takes on a perilous journey in order to find his beautiful wife, who has been kidnapped by brutal slave traders.

Despite its impressive cast and setting (on location in the [[Sahara]], and in Kenya, Israel, and [[Sicily]]), ''Ashanti'' was widely panned by critics upon release. Michael Caine was reportedly very disappointed with the project and claims it was the third worst film along with his previous films ''[[The Magus (film)|The Magus]]'' and ''[[The Swarm (film)|The Swarm]]'' (despite appearing in other failures in the 1980s). It was one of Holden's final films, and the final film of cinematographer [[Aldo Tonti]].

==Plot summary==
David and Anansa Linderby are doctors with the [[World Health Organization]]. On a medical mission carrying out an inoculation programme, they visit a West African village. While David takes photographs of tribal dancers, Anansa goes swimming alone. She is attacked and abducted by slave traders led by Suleiman, who mistake her for an [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] tribeswoman. The police can do nothing to find her and David has almost given up hope when he hears rumours that Anansa has been kidnapped by Suleiman to be sold to Arab Prince Hassan. The African authorities deny that the slave trade even exists. So David must find help in a shadowy world where the rescuers of slaves are just as ruthless as the traders themselves. As David tracks her across Africa and the Sahara desert, he is helped by a member of the [[Anti-Slavery International|Anti-Slavery League]], a mercenary helicopter pilot, and Malik, a tribesman who is seeking revenge on Suleiman.<ref>https://filestubealternative.wordpress.com/</ref>

The project was announced in January 1978 with [[Richard Sarafian|Richard C. Sarafian]] to direct, [[Michael Caine]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Peter Ustinov]] and [[Telly Savalas]] to star.<ref>{{cite news|title=Four Star's Cast In 'Ashanti' Film|work=New York Times|date=Jan 5, 1978|page=C18}}</ref> [[Ken Norton]] was offer a role in the film but turned it down.<ref>{{cite news|author=Christon, L. |date=Jun 4, 1978|title=Ken norton meets the challenges|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|158593395}}}}</ref><ref>

The film was shot on location in Kenya starting in April.<ref>{{cite news|author=Buckley, T. |date=May 26, 1978|title=At the movies.|work=New York Times|id={{ProQuest|123689311}}}}</ref> Two weeks into filming, director [[Richard Sarafian]] was sacked and replaced by [[Richard Fleischer]]. The female lead and cinematographer were fired. [[Telly Savalas]] who was in the cast had to drop out.<ref name="ashanti" /> Fleischer arranged for the script to be rewritten. [[George MacDonald Fraser]], who had recently adapted ''Tai Pan'' for the producers, was commissioned to work on the script to help boost Sharif's part.<ref name="fraser">George MacDonald Fraser, ''The Light's On at Signpost'', HarperCollins 2002 p205-206</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Hamilton: Divorce and dracula |date=May 18, 1978|work=Los Angeles Times|id={{ProQuest|158520135}}}}</ref>

Director Fleischer and co-star [[Beverly Johnson]] were supposedly both removed from filming two-thirds of the way through the shoot due to sunstroke.<ref>[http://www.citizencaine.org/films/ashanti.shtml ''Citizen Caine'' film review]</ref> However, an interview with Ms. Johnson included on the 2013 Severin Films Blu-ray edition of ''Ashanti'' makes no reference to these "removals", suggesting that they may belong to myth.
