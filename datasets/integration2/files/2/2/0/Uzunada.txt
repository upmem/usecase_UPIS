'''Uzunada''' or '''Uzun ada''' (literally "long island") is an island situated at the entry of the [[Gulf of İzmir]] on the west coast of [[Turkey]].

It is situated between the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Turkey]] in the west, and the district of [[Foça]] in the east. Stretching over a length of c. {{convert|9|km|0|abbr=off}} in north-south direction, it is Turkey's fourth largest island, and its third largest in the [[Aegean Sea]].

The island has been called by many names.  Its ancient Greek name was ''Drymoussa'' (Δρυμούσσα), and it is also known under its later Greek names of ''Makronisi'' ("long island") or ''Englezonisi'' ("Englishmen's island"),<ref name="yeni1">(16 Nov 2012).

To its south are several smaller islets, including [[Yassıca Island|Yassıca]].   It has also been called "Chustan Island" (or Keustan).<ref name="chustan1">[https://books.google.com/books?id=ADqwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA191#v=onepage&q&f=false Mediterranean Pilot, Volume 4], pp. 191-92 (4th ed. 1908)</ref>

"Uzunada" is also the name of several other, smaller islets along the Turkish Aegean coast.<ref name="geonames"/> Uzunada is currently closed to settlements due to military activities.

==History==

[[Thucydides]] briefly mentions Drymoussa as a location where some ships of Astyochus put in for eight days during a period of high winds in the 20th year of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref name="thucy">[http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/thucydides/thucydides-passages.php?pleaseget=8.31-35 Thucydides, 8.31] (" He was himself carried to Phocaea and Cymè, and the remainder of the fleet put into the islands, Marathussa, Pelè, and Drymussa, which lie off Clazomenae. There, being detained eight days by the weather, they spoiled and destroyed part of the property of the Clazomenians which had been deposited in the islands")</ref>

After the [[Treaty of Apamea]] was concluded in 188 B.C., the city of [[Clazomenae]] was awarded the island.<ref name="dry2">[https://books.google.com/books?id=wB0QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA632#v=onepage&q&f=false A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, Volume 1], p. 632 (1872)</ref><ref name="pinker">[[John Pinkerton|Pinkerton, John]].

Despite claims of ownership of an English family dating from the mid-19th century, by 1914 there were about 2,000 [[Ottoman Greeks]] living on the island.<ref name="claims">[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=AMBPA19261210.2.2 Turkish Island Romance], Akaroa Mail and Banks Peninsula Advertiser, Volume LI, Issue 5241, 10 December 1926, Page 1 (reprinted from The London Times)</ref>

During [[World War I]], the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] occupied the island (referred to as "Chustan") in 1916, where they also issued some rare stamps.<ref name="1916one">[http://navsource.org/archives/08/pdf/0836045k.pdf Stamp Collectors will be Kept Busy], ''The Tomahawk'' (date?)</ref><ref name="stamp2">[http://www.filatelia.fi/articles/neareast.html#long SMALL ISLANDS IN THE NEAR EAST], PHILATELIC EXPERTS, Retrieved 22 May 2015</ref>
