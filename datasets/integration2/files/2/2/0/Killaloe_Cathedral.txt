'''The Cathedral Church of St Flannan, Killaloe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɪ|l|ə|ˈ|l|uː}} {{respell|kil|ə|LOO}}) is a [[cathedral]] of the [[Church of Ireland]] in [[Killaloe, County Clare]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Province of Dublin (Church of Ireland)|Dublin]].

Previously the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Killaloe]], it is now one of three cathedrals in the [[Diocese of Limerick and Killaloe|United Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe]]. The Dean of the Cathedral is the Very Reverend Gary Paulsen who is also [[Dean of Killaloe]], [[Dean of Kilfenora]] and both Dean and Provost of [[Kilmacduagh]]

==Architecture==
Killaloe Cathedral dates from the transition between the Romanesque and Gothic periods.{{when|date=August 2016}} The font is decorated with arabesque ornaments.<ref>"[https://archive.org/details/cathedralsofthec027771mbp/page/n176/mode/1up The Cathedrals of the Church of Ireland"] [[John Godfrey FitzMaurice Day|Day, J.G.F./]] [[Henry Edmund Patton|Patton, H.E.]] p147: [[London]], [[SPCK|S.P.C.K.]], [[1932]]</ref> On the north side of the cathedral is a small oratory or chapel of a date far prior to the cathedral; and probably the original sanctuary of the holy man who founded the abbey. Its roof is very deep, and made entirely of stone; it has a belfry, and two doorways to the east and west.<ref>''Journal of a Tour in Ireland, A.D. 1806'' by Richard Colt Hoare</ref>

In the bell tower is a chime of eight bells cast by Matthew O'Byrne of Dublin in 1896. The heaviest bell weighs just over 500 kilograms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/145042134.pdf|title=The Ringing World.|access-date=18 November 2018}}</ref>

==Recent restoration==
A £200,000 restoration project involving the repair of a Romanesque doorway and the reconstruction of a 12th-century high cross, was completed in 2001. The Kilfenora Cross, embedded in the walls of the Gothic cathedral in the 1930s, is once again free-standing. The imposing 12-ft monument is now in the nave of the building.<ref>[http://ireland.archiseek.com/news/2001/000032.htm Restoration project for St Flannan's Cathedral] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013065828/http://ireland.archiseek.com/news/2001/000032.htm |date=2008-10-13 }}</ref>
