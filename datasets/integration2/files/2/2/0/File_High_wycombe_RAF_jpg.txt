==Fair use rationale for [[RAF High Wycombe]]==
#No free-licensed or public domain images have been located that would serve as a suitable replacement for this image.
#Given the purpose this image is being used for in the article, it is unlikely that any such image will be located in the future (copyright for departmental logos and the Royal Arms are protected by [[Letters Patent]] and will never expire under the terms of the Copyrights Designs and Patents Act 1988.)
#As a squadron logo, the image has little to no commercial value, and its reproduction here will not deleteriously affect profits for the copyright holder.
#The image is being used here for informational purposes only, and its use on the English-language Wikipedia is not predicted to affect the value of the image or that of its copyright in any way.
