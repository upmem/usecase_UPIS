'''William Teel Baird''' ([[Circa|c.]] 1819 – February 23, 1897) was born on the upper Saint John River in [[New Brunswick]] where his father, [[John Baird (educator)|John Baird]], was a school teacher.

Baird was trained as a pharmacist and in 1839 he moved to [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]] to open his own business. There he explored his many interests including music and books. His first interest was the militia, which he had joined in [[Fredericton|Fredericton, New Brunswick]] in 1836, and he continued with this pursuit in his new home.

Baird made large contributions to the militia in the province beginning in 1861 and the [[Trent Affair]] where he organized the militia to thwart British troop desertions. Under instructions from Lieutenant Governor [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton Gordon]], he organized the ''Home Guard'' during the time of the threat of [[Fenian raids]]. He retired as a Quartermaster General.

William Teel Baird's other noteworthy contribution to history was his autobiography, ''Seventy years of New Brunswick life'', which gives a particular insight into the militia and the political climate of the times.
