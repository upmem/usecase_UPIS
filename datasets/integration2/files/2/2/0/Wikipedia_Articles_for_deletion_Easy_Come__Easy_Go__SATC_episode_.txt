Single, unnotable episode of Sex and the City that fails [[WP:EPISODE]] and [[WP:FICTION]].  Nothing but a short plot summary and cast list.  Merge unneeded as plot summary is already covered in [[List of Sex and the City episodes]].  Failed Prod.

*'''Delete''', episode does not seem to have had any significance in the wider world, so it cannot "(offer) detail on a work's development, impact or historical significance" (from [[WP:NOT]]).

*'''Delete''' - per [[WP:EPISODE]], which, while a guideline, states that episodes are not exempt from [[WP:N]], which this does not appear to meet. [[User:LonelyBeacon|LonelyBeacon]] ([[User talk:LonelyBeacon|talk]]) 04:16, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
