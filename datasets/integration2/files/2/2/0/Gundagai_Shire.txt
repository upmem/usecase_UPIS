'''Gundagai Shire''' was a [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]], Australia. On 12 May 2016, Gundagai Shire was abolished and merged with the neighbouring [[Cootamundra Shire]] to establish [[Gundagai Council]].<ref name="merger">{{cite web |url=https://www.strongercouncils.nsw.gov.au/new-councils/gundagai-council/ |title=Gundagai Council |publisher=New South Wales Government |accessdate=20 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611155448/https://www.strongercouncils.nsw.gov.au/new-councils/gundagai-council/ |archive-date=11 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Shire was located adjacent to the [[Hume Highway]].  Gundagai Shire is primarily rural, with a small population. 80% of the Shire's population live in the town of [[Gundagai, New South Wales|Gundagai]].  The four villages in the Shire were [[Coolac, New South Wales|Coolac]], [[Tumblong, New South Wales|Tumblong]], [[Muttama, New South Wales|Muttama]] and [[Nangus, New South Wales|Nangus]], with populations ranging from 40 to 90 people.

The last [[Mayor]] of Gundagai Shire was [[Councillor|Cr.]] Abb McAlister, an [[Independent (politician)|unaligned]] politician.<ref name=mayor/>

==History==
Gundagai was declared a Municipality in [[1889 in Australia|1889]], and [[Adjungbilly Shire]] Council created in [[1906 in Australia|1906]] to administer the district. The Municipality of Gundagai and the Adjungbilly Shire were amalgamated on 1 January 1924 to form the Gundagai Shire Council, which was the administrative body of the area.<ref>{{Gazette NSW| title = Local Government Act 1919.

A [[Local government areas of New South Wales#Reviews of local government areas|2015 review of local government boundaries]] recommended that Gundagai Shire merge with adjoining councils. The [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger between the Gundagai and [[Cootamundra Shire|Cootamundra]] shires to form a new council with an area of {{convert|3981|km2}} and support a population of approximately {{formatnum:11500}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dpc-olg-ss.s3.amazonaws.com/e066e55e34580b6248025f0d87bf4dc9/Cootamundra-Gundagai.pdf |title=Merger proposal: Cootamundra Council, Gundagai Shire Council |publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |date=January 2016 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |page=7 }}</ref> The alternative, proposed by [[Harden Shire]] on 28 February 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Cootamundra, Gundagai and Harden shires.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dpc-olg-ss.s3.amazonaws.com/1456972721/assets/Uploads/COOTAMUNDRA-GUNDAGAI-HARDEN-SHIRE-COUNCILS.pdf |title=Fit For Future: Alternate Merger Proposal - Harden Shire Council |publisher=[[Government of New South Wales]] |date=28 February 2016 |accessdate=8 March 2016 |author=Harden Shire Council }}</ref> Following an independent review, on 12 May 2016 the [[Minister for Local Government (New South Wales)|Minister for Local Government]] announced the dissolution of the Cootamunda and Gundagai shires, with their area merging to establish the [[Gundagai Council]].<ref name="merger"/> After the merger was gazetted, opposition continued through a Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/Save-Gundagai-Shire-675718309237964/timeline | title=Save Gundagai Shire |website=Facebook |accessdate=22 May 2016}}</ref>
