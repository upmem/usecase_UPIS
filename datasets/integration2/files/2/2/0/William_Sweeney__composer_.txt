'''William John Sweeney''' (born 5 January 1950) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[composer]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Glasgow]], he attended [[Knightswood Secondary School]]. He studied the [[musical composition|clarinet]] and [[Musical composition|composition]] at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] from 1967 to 1970, and at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] from 1970 to 1973, where his teachers included [[Alan Hacker]] and [[Harrison Birtwistle]]. He went on to teach [[woodwind]] instruments, and then composition at the [[University of Glasgow]]. An early influence was the European [[avant-garde]], particularly [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], though he returned to [[tonality|tonal]] composition in the mid-1970s.

His work is strongly influenced by traditional Scottish [[folk music]]; in particular, he has utilised the [[heterophonic]] style of [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] [[psalm]]-singing, and the [[piobaireachd]] form; he varies [[melody|melodies]] through [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]], as in traditional [[pibroch]], and in their contour; he modifies instruments' tone-colours through alternative fingerings. He has a strong regard for the music of [[Leoš Janáček]]. He has also addressed the reconciliation of classical and traditional music with [[jazz]], using [[improvisation]]al techniques and sometimes combining the two idioms. He has been influenced by [[ancient Greek]] poetry, and Indian and Arab traditions in his use of [[ostinato]] and other techniques of varied repetition.

His Sonata for cello and piano (2010) won the 2011 British Composer Award in the "Instrumental Solo or Duo" category.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131002151011/http://www.basca.org.uk/news/british-composer-awards-2011-shortlist-announced/ Winners of the 2011 British Composer Awards] (archive from 2 October 2013, accessed 29 July 2020).</ref>
