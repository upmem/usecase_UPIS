==Foreign service career==

Heath was a [[White House]] correspondent for United Press International from February 1916 to August 1917 and then again from October 1919 to September 1920.  From August 1917 to October 1919 he was first lieutenant in U.S. Army in [[World War I]].  In 1920 he began a career in the foreign service that would last four decades.

From 1920 to 1929, Heath held consular positions in [[Romania]], [[Poland]], and [[Switzerland]].  From 1929 to 1932 he was a consul at the American Embassy in [[Port-au-Prince, Haiti]] and he was then assistant chief of the Division of Latin American Affairs at the State Department.  From 1937 to 1941 he was the First Secretary at the U.S. Embassy in [[Berlin]] before the American entry into the war.  Then from 1941 to 1944 he was a consul in [[Santiago, Chile]] followed by less than a year as the chief of the Division of North and West Coast Affairs at the State Department.

In 1944 Heath returned to Europe as an advisor to fellow Kansan General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].  He remained in Germany as an advisor on reconstruction until 1947 when he was posted as U.S. Ambassador to [[Bulgaria]].  In 1949 Bulgaria charged deputy premier [[Traicho Kostov]] with plotting against the Communist regime and added Heath’s name to the charges to give the case "its proper anticapitalist flavor."  The Bulgarian government declared Heath ''persona non grata'' and the U.S. promptly broke off diplomatic relations.  1956, Bulgaria re-examined the case exonerating Kostov years after he had been executed.  In 1959 Bulgaria dropped all charges against Heath and diplomatic relations were restored.<ref>"National Affairs: Back to Sofia,"  ''Time'', April 6, 1959, Available at http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,810861,00.html.  Accessed October 27, 2009.</ref>

Following his expulsion from Bulgaria, Heath was posted as the first U.S. Ambassador to the newly independent countries in Indochina including [[Laos]] (1950–1954), [[Cambodia]] (1950–1954) and [[South Vietnam]] (1950–1954).  During these concurrent postings he was resident in [[Saigon]].  Heath supported the [[Domino Theory]] and wrote that if the French pulled out "Only the blind could doubt the immediate Communist engulfment of Southeast Asia."<ref>"The Domino Theory", Edwin Moise, available online at http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/A-D/The-Domino-Theory.html.

Accessed on October 27, 2009.</ref>  In October 1954 Heath and Lieutenant General [[John W. O'Daniel|John W. "Iron Mike" O'Daniel]] were authorized to begin a crash program to improve "the loyalty and effectiveness of the Free Vietnamese Forces."  The result was a formal agreement in December between representatives of France, the Republic of Vietnam, and the United States to supply direct aid through the Military Assistance Program (MAP).

He was next the U.S. Ambassador to [[Lebanon]] (1955–1958), [[Yemen]] (1957–1959), and, finally, [[Saudi Arabia]] (1958–1961).

==Post-diplomatic work==

Following his retirement from the Foreign Service in 1961, he held a professorship at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]].

Heath died in [[Orinda, California]] on October 15, 1981.  He was survived by a daughter, Sue L. Brown, a son, Donald R. Heath, Jr., seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
