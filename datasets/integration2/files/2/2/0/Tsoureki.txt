==Etymology==

The Greek word ''tsoureki'' is borrowed from Turkish ''[[:tr:Çörek|çörek]]''. Some dictionaries claim that this is derived from the Old Turkish root ''çevir-'' 'turn';

==Greek tradition==
There are different variations of the Greek ''tsoureki'' holiday breads including a round Christmas loaf with a cross decoration called ''Christopsomo'', a braided [[easter bread]] with whole dyed eggs pressed into the dough called ''lampropsomo'', and a loaf with a coin hidden inside for good luck called ''vasilopita'' that is baked for St. Basil's Day (New Year's Day).<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-931362-4| title = The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets| date = 2015-04-01 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPNgBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT207}}</ref>
