'''The Ohio Alliance for Public Charter Schools''' was a [[Non-profit organization|nonprofit]] [[Membership organization|membership association]] based in [[Columbus, Ohio]] that was formed in 2006. It was composed of more than 200 [[charter school]] and related organizational members.  It provides [[advocacy]] and [[technical support]] services for member schools.

The organization was founded with initial grants from the Walton Family Foundation, the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], the Fisher Fund and the [[National Alliance for Public Charter Schools]] Bill Sims was its founding president and CEO from 2006-2014. The current president and CEO is RaShaun Holliman.

The Ohio Alliance for Public Charter Schools purported to focus on improving the quality of charter schools in [[Ohio]] through its technical support and [[performance management]] programs.  The Alliance organized a national conference in 2010, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to exhibit [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322093135/http://www.oapcs.org/files/u115/NBCP_Publication_FINAL_SPREADS_LR__2.pdf promising cooperative programs] between traditional [[school district]]s and charter schools and it remains a repository for such collaborative practices throughout the [[United States]].

The organization was disbanded at the end of 2016.<ref name="pb161220">{{cite web|last1=Phillis|first1=William|title=The Ohio Alliance For Public Charter Schools (OAPCS) Going Out Of Business|url=http://plunderbund.com/2016/12/20/the-ohio-alliance-for-public-charter-schools-oapcs-going-out-of-business/|publisher=Plunderbund|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name="cd161214">{{cite news|last1=Bush|first1=Bill|title=Ohio charter-school advocacy group disbanding|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/12/14/ohio-charter-school-advocacy-group-disbanding.html|accessdate=26 January 2018|publisher=Columbus Dispatch|date=December 14, 2016}}</ref>
