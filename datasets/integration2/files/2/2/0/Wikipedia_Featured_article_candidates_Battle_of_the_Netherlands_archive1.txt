*'''Weak object''' It's a ''very'' nice article, and I'd be happy to support if/when the references are cleaned up. I see two pretty decent sized problems right now. First, only 3 sources is somewhat limited for a featured article, as it isn't providing a very wide range of opinions/information. Second, see [[Wikipedia:Inline Citation]], as that's a necessity. Definetly fixable, and I'd easily change my vote. [[User:Staxringold|Staxringold]] 21:13, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Object''', for now. Needs some careful copy-editing and rewriting for clarity, more formal language, etc. Some examples of problems: 
:The first paragraph gives no years: "''The battle lasted from 10 May until 17 May during...''" and "''The battle ended after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam...''", i.e. bombing of Rotterdam in what year?

:Passages such as: "''The Netherlands had been neutral during World War I but — mainly because of the Boer Wars — at the time sympathies were clearly more on the German side, although the Dutch were shocked by the atrocities committed against the Belgian civilian population and sheltered more than a million refugees. In fact at the end of the war, when the German Kaiser Wilhelm II fled, he was given a castle called Huis ter Doorn in the Netherlands where he lived until his death in 1941.''" are unclear, with apparent non-sequiturs.

:And phrases like: "''The governments just didn't see it as 'such a big deal'''" and "''The Dutch equipment shortages were so bad it actually limited the number''" are too informal, agrammatical and confusing ("''governments''" ? how many did the Netherlands have?). If these sorts of problems are fixed up it will be easier to judge what otherwise seems like a promising article. [[User:Pinkville|Pinkville]] 22:08, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. Fantastic article, but:
#It lacks inline citations
#The prose is not "brilliant" and isn't formal enough for an encyclopaedia. 
#There seems to be a NPOV problem in the "The Dutch forces" section (among others) - ''who'', for example, thinks "the most obvious deficiency of the Dutch Army lay in its shortage of armour"? Statements like these need to be attributed to some authority, otherwise it's POV/OR. 
#The article peters out in the end - the last four sections seem to be afterthoughts.

*'''Object'''. The lead is too small. There are stub sections - The first days, The last days. No inline citations. Also, a map of the combat (in addition to maps of pre-war positions) would be nice, as well as more photos.--[[User:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus]] <sup><font color="green">[[User_talk:Piotrus|Talk]]</font></sup> 17:19, 1 April 2006 (UTC)
