It's a vanity article, with what looks like articles copied directly into it. So basically, it's crap. [[User:Disavian|Disavian]] 21:12, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. [[User:Arnzy|-- Arnzy]] ([[User talk:Arnzy|Talk]]) 21:17, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as per nom. [[User:Scientizzle|Scientizzle]] 21:25, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' ''"For immediate release..."'' This is a series of press releases that fails to assert the notability of the subject. [[WP:BIO]] refers.
