'''Odd Olai Aalen''' (born 6 May 1947, in [[Oslo]]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[statistician]] and a [[professor]] at the Department of Biostatistics at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the [[University of Oslo]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Odd Aalen Olai|url=http://www.uio.no/?vrtx=person-view&uid=oaalen|work=Universitetet i Oslo|accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref>

==Life==
Aalen completed his [[examen artium]] in 1966 at [[Oslo Cathedral School]] before studying first mathematics and physics and then statistics in which he graduated at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | last =Borgan | first =Ørnulf | title =Odd Aalen | work =Norsk biografisk leksikon | publisher = Store norske leksikon | date =13 February 2009 | url =http://nbl.snl.no/Odd_Aalen | accessdate =30 April 2014 | language =Norwegian }}</ref>

==Work==
His research work is geared towards applications in [[bioscience]]s. Aalen's early work on [[counting process]]es and [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]], starting with his 1976 Ph.D. thesis at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has had profound influence in [[biostatistics]]. Inferences for fundamental quantities associated with cumulative hazard rates, in [[survival analysis]] and models for analysis of event histories, are typically based on the [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] or appropriate related statistics. The [[Nelson–Aalen estimator]] is related to the [[Kaplan-Meier estimator]] and generalisations thereof.

Aalen is currently the leader of the Centre for Biostatistical Modelling in the Medical Sciences at the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Oslo]].

==Honors and awards==
He is an elected member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].{{cn|date=August 2020}}
