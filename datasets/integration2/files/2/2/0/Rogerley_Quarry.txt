'''Rogerley Quarry''' is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in the [[Wear Valley]] district of west [[County Durham]], [[England]]. It lies on the edge of the valley of the [[River Wear]], alongside the [[A689 road]], about 1&nbsp;km upriver from the village of [[Frosterley]].

The site is a disused quarry and has been designated as of national importance in the [[Geological Conservation Review]] as a key site for sedimentological studies. The quarry exhibits a long section of basal [[Namurian]] [[sandstone]]s which derive from [[riverine]] [[sedimentation]]. The quarry face intersects the ancient river channel at right angles, allowing the lateral changes in deposition across the channel to be clearly seen.<ref name="SSSI">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/1001374.pdf |title=Rogerley Quarry |year=1984 |publisher=[[English Nature]] |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>
