She later stated it was embarrassing to look back on in a 2007 BBC interview, although at the time it was great since she was a Spice Girls fan. She also modelled in [[Lemar|Lemar's]] video for "50:50", and in [[So Solid Crew|So Solid's]] video for "[[Broken Silence (song)|Broken Silence]]".<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6214201.stm|title=Sound of 2007: Sadie Ama|date=2007-01-02|access-date=2019-07-28|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190728023730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6214201.stm|archive-date=28 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" />

In 2005, she signed up for [[Arts Council England|Arts Council]] which provided her funding for music.<ref name=":1" />

Sadie had wanted to be a singer when she was younger, but never properly pursued it until she met up with Terror Danjah (a [[Grime (music genre)|grime]] producer), her friends cousin, who gave her a track for her to sing on. A year later in 2006, she finally released the song titled "So Sure" featuring grime MC [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]] and produced by Terror Danjah. Her sister Shola Ama was active in helping her write songs and teaching her how to make music.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /> She was only 15 at the time it was released. She stated in an interview that the pressures and anxiety were a lot for her at the time, and put a pause on music as a result, instead opting to go to college.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":1" />

In 2007, she was voted in at #4 on the BBC's [[Sound of...|Sound of]] 2007 poll.
