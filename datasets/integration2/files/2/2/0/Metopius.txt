He served as [[bishop]] of [[Britonia]], and represented his see at the [[Fourth Council of Toledo]] in 633. The diocese of Britonia had been established for the [[Celtic Britons]] who had settled in the region ''en masse''{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} during the previous century, and Metopius' attendance of the Council of Toledo demonstrates its survival in the 7th century.
