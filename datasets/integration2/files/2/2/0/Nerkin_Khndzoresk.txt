'''Nerkin Khndzoresk''' ({{lang-hy|Ներքին Խնձորեսկ}}) is a village and [[Community (Armenia)|rural community]] (municipality) in the [[Syunik Region|Syunik Province]] of [[Armenia]].  The [[National Statistical Service of the Republic of Armenia]] (ARMSTAT) reported its population was 321 in 2010,<ref>{{ARMSTATdata|44}}</ref> up from 184 at the 2001 census.<ref>{{ArmenianCensus|210}}</ref> After the administrative reforms in September 2016, Nerkin Khndzoresk is part of [[Goris]] community.

== Overview ==
Nerkin Khndzoresk, a border village in South-East [[Armenia]], lies in Armenia’s Syunik Marz region. The small village is located 21&nbsp;km from [[Goris]] off the [[Stepanakert]] highway. The village lies 7&nbsp;km from the upper [[Khndzoresk]] village connected by farm fields and one bumpy dirt road. The remote village is positioned below the larger village and surrounded by rolling hills, gorges, and scenic mountains.

=== Population and infrastructure ===
The village of Nerkin Khndzoresk has approximately 320 people. The majority of the population is of Armenian descent, including ethnic Armenian refugees who settled in the area after fleeing [[Azerbaijan]] during the [[First Nagorno-Karabakh War]]. The citizens mainly identify as Armenian Apostolic Christians and speak Armenian and often Russian. The area is impoverished with little employment outside of self-sufficient farming and gardening. Substance farming and animal breeding are the main sources of livelihood. Throughout the village the social relationships are harmonious and the area is not segregated by class or occupation.

== History ==
The village was founded in 1983 as a result of resizing of the bigger village of [[Khndzoresk]]. After the foundation of the village of [[Khndzoresk]], the lower Nerkin Khndzoresk was established to strengthen the southeastern borders of [[Armenia]], and was strategically placed below the larger village to prevent enemies from attacking. However, any expansion and maintenance of the area ceased after the fall of the Soviet Union.
