The '''Yamaha WR450F''' is an [[Types of motorcycles#Off-road|off-road]] motorcycle made by [[Yamaha Motor Company]]. It currently has a {{Convert|450|cc|abbr=on}} [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid-cooled]] [[single-cylinder]] engine. First offered in 1998 at 400cc, it shared many components and design concepts with the [[Yamaha YZ450F#First generation: YZ400F 1998–2000|YZ400F]] motocross model. It is basically the racing [[Yamaha YZ450F|YZ450F]] detuned slightly for more controllable power, with a headlight and lighting coil, softer suspension, a [[kickstand]], lower noise specifications, larger radiators and lower emissions. The WR in the name indicates a [[Gear train#Wide-ratio vs. close-ratio transmission|wide-ratio gear box]] common to most [[Enduro motorcycle|enduro]] or trail bikes and stands in contrast to the close-ratio gearbox essential to a [[motocross]] racer. Over the years the WR has benefited from the advances made in the YZ motocross version gaining displacement and advancements such as an aluminum frame and improved suspension.  Over much of its life the weight of the WR450F has remained fairly constant ranging from 244 to 249 pounds [[Wet weight|dry weight]].<ref name=YMC/>

==First generation: WR400F - 1998-2000==

Yamaha introduced the WR 400F in 1998. The 400F is a {{Convert|400|cc|abbr=on}} four-stroke off-road motorcycle produced for three years, beginning in 1998 and ending in 2000 (only the YZ was upgraded to 426&nbsp;cc in 2000). The WR400F is related to the YZ400F, a motocross model. Like the YZ400, it was considered to be a groundbreaking model in motorcycle history, ushering in the four-stroke era which ended the dominance of [[two-stroke engine]]s in motocross and offroad racing. While many modern performance four-stroke dirt bikes have been criticized for excessive rebuild costs and short motor lifespans, the Yamaha WR400F has an impressive record of reliability, often attributed to its steel valves and generous oil capacity.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Second generation: WR426F - 2001-2002==
In 2001 the WR400F's engine was uprated and it became the WR426F increasing the displacement to {{Convert|426|cc|abbr=on}} for greater power and throttle response.{{citation needed|reason=increasing the displacement ... for ... throttle response|date=September 2017}} A beefier YZ style clutch basket and plates than those on the WR400 improved clutch performance. Frame geometry was identical to the 2002 YZ250 and YZ426F with a 58.7 inch wheelbase and 14.7 inches of ground clearance. This was the last WR to make use of a manual compression release for starting.

For 2003, the engine displacement was increased to {{Convert|449|cc|abbr=on}}, the fuel tank was reduced to 2.6 gallons <ref name=YMC>http://www.yamaha-motor.com/sport/products/modelspeccompare/210/1132/0/compare.aspx</ref> and the bike came with an electric starter as standard equipment.

A limited production version of the WR450F was the WR450F 2-Trac, which featured [[2WD|2-wheel drive]]. The gearbox output sprocket drove a short, fully enclosed chain to a pump, which in turn pushed the oil to the front hub via the pipe and back via the parallel pipe.<ref name="Blezard">{{cite web|last=Blezard|first=Paul|title=Yamaha WR450F 2-Trac - Review|url=http://www.mcnews.com.au/testing/yamaha/wr-2trac/page1.htm|work=www.mcnews.com.au|accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref> A maximum of 15% of the power was transmitted to the front wheel at any time.<ref name="Blezard" /> Yamaha planned on building 250 2-Tracs in 2004, but only a few were built, which were used for [[Motorcycle enduro|enduro]] racing.<ref name="Blezard" /> 2006 was the last year of the steel frames.

The 2003 and 2004 models were red sticker bikes in California.

For 2016,  the WR was given the reverse slant, 4-valve, fuel injected motor previously available in the [[Yamaha_YZ450F#Fifth_generation_YZ450F_2010-Present|YZ450F]] since 2010. Yamaha also introduced a new model, the YZ450FX, a more [[Enduro]] competition oriented version of the off-road 450 utilizing more design elements of the motocross model such as stiffer suspension and a close ratio gear box while maintaining electric start and the 18" rear wheel.

For 2017, the WR450F largely remained the same, except for modifications to the air box cover as well as a change from silver to black rims.

For 2018, the WR450F remained similar to the 2016-2017 models, with a large distinction being that the bike was no longer available to register as green sticker in the state of California.
