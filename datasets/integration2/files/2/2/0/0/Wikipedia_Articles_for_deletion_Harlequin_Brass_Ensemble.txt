:({{Find sources AFD|Harlequin Brass Ensemble}})
A non notable music ensemble. Unreferenced with [[WP:BEFORE]] showing no evidence of any reliable sources. No edits to text since 2010. Most of the article explains the general concept of a 10-piece brass ensemble, which is not unique to this group.

*'''Delete''' - No compelling coverage. Virtually no mention in the media other than conductor changes and additions to the ensemble. The ensemble seems to have one non-notable recording and that's about it. [[User:Sulfurboy|Sulfurboy]] ([[User talk:Sulfurboy|talk]]) 03:01, 9 May 2020 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per the nominator and Sulfurboy, my research brings up the same lack of results theirs did. [[User:Thryduulf|Thryduulf]] ([[User talk:Thryduulf|talk]]) 11:53, 10 May 2020 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as the article is very promotional to the extent that a speedy deletion G11 would be justified. No reliable sources in the article and I found no obvious rs on google and little coverage of any kind at this time, imv [[User:Atlantic306|Atlantic306]] ([[User talk:Atlantic306|talk]]) 19:25, 14 May 2020 (UTC)
