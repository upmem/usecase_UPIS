*The use of this image on Wikipedia is contended to be a fair use, since it is used solely for educational purposes in a not-for-profit encyclopedia, is necessary for cultural and historical purposes, and the material value of the possible copyright is not believed to be lessened by its use here
*It is believed that the use of this image on the English-language Wikipedia to illustrate an article on the person in question falls under the "Non-profit educational" clause of the Fair Use doctrine currently upheld by United States law.

*It is a low resolution copy
*It is only being used to illustrate the article in question
*The image is irreplaceable; a free analogue is impossible to produce as the original will be covered by copyright for the foreseeable future
*Owing to the limited web-resolution of the image, only a small portion of a copyrighted work is used
*It does not limit the copyright owner's rights to sell the image in any way
*For the same reasons, the portion of the copyrighted work used is of inherently lower quality than the original, reducing the risk of competitiveness and therefore the effects of this copy on the market for or value of versions held by the owner of the copyright
