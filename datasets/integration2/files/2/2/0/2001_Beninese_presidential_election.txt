{{Politics of Benin}}

'''Presidential elections''' were held in [[Benin]] on 4 March 2001, with a second round run-off on 18 March. They controversially resulted in the re-election of [[Mathieu Kérékou]] for a second term. Kérékou's rival [[Nicéphore Soglo]], who had been president from 1991 to 1996, failed in his bid to reclaim the presidency; although he qualified to participate in the second round of the election against Kérékou, he refused to do so, alleging [[electoral fraud]]. [[Adrien Houngbédji]], the parliament speaker and third-placed candidate, also refused to participate in a second round. As a result, Kérékou faced fourth-place candidate [[Bruno Amoussou]], who was planning minister and had already given his support to Kérékou, in the second round; Kérékou won an easy victory with 84% of the vote.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1263931.stm "Benin 'day of mourning'"] BBC News, 6 April 2001</ref><ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/bj.html Elections in Benin] African Elections Database</ref>
