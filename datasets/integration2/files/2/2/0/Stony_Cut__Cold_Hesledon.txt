'''Stony Cut, Cold Hesledon''' is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] in the [[Easington (district)|Easington]] district of north-east [[County Durham]], [[England]]. It consists of a shallow cutting alongside [[Seaham]] Golf Course close to the village of [[Cold Hesledon]].

The cutting exposes a section of [[Lopingian|Late Permian]] Ford Formation ([[Zechstein]]) [[dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] in which the transition from the flat to the crest of the shelf-edge of an ancient [[reef]] is clearly visible. The site has been designated as of national importance in the [[Geological Conservation Review]].<ref name="SSSI">{{cite web |url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000046.pdf |title=Stony Cut, Cold Hesledon |year=1996 |publisher=[[English Nature]] |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>
