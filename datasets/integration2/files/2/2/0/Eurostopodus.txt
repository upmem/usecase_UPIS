'''''Eurostopodus''''' is a genus of [[eared nightjar]] in the family [[Caprimulgidae]]. This genus is distinctive among the Old World nightjars in lacking long rictal bristles. It also shows some features that are not shared with Caprimulginae and Chordeilinae, like having a larger size or the variable presence of ear-tufts, juveniles showing rufous plumage, long incubation periods and brown-reds and black spotted eggs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Nightjars and their Allies|last=Holyoak|first=D.T|publisher=Oxford|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>
