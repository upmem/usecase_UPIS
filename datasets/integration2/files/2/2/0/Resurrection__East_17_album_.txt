'''''Resurrection''''' is the fourth studio album by [[East 17]], the first without member [[Tony Mortimer]] and the last to feature [[Brian Harvey]]. They would also use new name '''E-17'''. The album was released on 16 November 1998 and is softer in tone than its predecessors, with the main genre being R&B as opposed to the dance and pop music from previous years. 

"[[Each Time]]" and "Betcha Can't Wait" were released as singles. "Each Time" peaked at No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], while "Betcha Can't Wait" peaked at No. 12.<ref name="uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/east%2017/|title=UK Charts<nowiki>></nowiki>East 17|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref>

==Greatest==
In 2013, after Tony Mortimer's departure from the 3-piece East 17 of 2010-2012, the album "Resurrection" was re-released via the Demon Music Group under the name " '''''Greatest''''' ". Very little information on this release is available. The track-listing is re-arranged slightly.
