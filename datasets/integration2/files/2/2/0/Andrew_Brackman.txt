==College career==
[[image:Andrew Brackman basketball NC State.jpg|175px|right|thumb|Andrew Brackman playing basketball for North Carolina State University]]
Brackman attended [[North Carolina State University]] where he played two seasons as a dual-sport athlete, in basketball and baseball. During his freshman basketball season (2004â€“2005), he played center and forward averaging 7.4 points and 3.5 rebounds.<ref name=CBS>{{cite news|url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/story/8491812 |title=Brackman's talent will stay on display at N.C.

In his freshman baseball season, he was 4-0 with a 2.09 ERA in 10 appearances as both a reliever and later, as a starting pitcher.  He was starting pitcher of the first game of the [[2005 ACC Baseball Tournament]], striking out five batters in seven innings to earn the victory against the [[Miami Hurricanes baseball|Miami Hurricanes]].  He was named a second-team preseason All-America player by ''[[Baseball America]]'' for 2006.<ref name="GoPack.com" />

After the [[NC State Wolfpack|Wolfpack]] was defeated in the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2006 NCAA tournament]] second round by Texas, Brackman chose not to return to the basketball team the next season,  and instead focused on developing his pitching with hopes of doing well in professional baseball.

Brackman suffered a  stress fracture to his hip in his sophomore year of baseball limiting him to only seven  games and a disappointing 1-4 record with a 6.09 ERA.<ref name=ESPN>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/columns/story?columnist=katz_andy&id=2614344|title=Brackman, busy with baseball, hasn't decided on return|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2006-10-05|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/B/Andrew-Brackman.shtml |title=Andrew Brackman Statistics |publisher=The Baseball Cube |accessdate=2010-09-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100830022306/http://thebaseballcube.com/players/B/Andrew-Brackman.shtml| archivedate= 30 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>  In the summer of that year, he pitched for the [[Orleans Cardinals]] in the [[Cape Cod League]] earning a 1-0 record with a 1.09 ERA.<ref name="ESPN" /> This effort led to ''Baseball America'' ranking him the league's number two prospect.

Brackman's junior year at NC State saw a return to his freshman-year numbers: in 13 games he struck out 74 batters in 78 innings with a 3.81 ERA and a record of 6-4, but due to elbow injuries, he did not pitch in either the ACC nor the NCAA tournament.<ref name=NewYorkPost>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/08272007/sports/yankees/yanks__top_pick_to_have_surger.htm|title=Yanks's top pick to have surgery|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=2007-08-27|accessdate=2008-02-27|first=George|last=King}}</ref>

==Professional career==

===New York Yankees===
Brackman's injury record hurt his draft value, and he was not selected until the 30th pick of the [[2007 Major League Baseball Draft]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/draft/y2007/drafttracker.jsp |title=2007 MLB.com Draft tracker |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref>  Following the draft, the Yankees signed Brackman to a guaranteed $4.5 million deal for four years including a $3.55 million signing bonus spread out over six years.<ref name=NewYorkTimes>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/sports/baseball/17pins.html?_r=1&fta=y&oref=slogin|title=Good News on the Health of the Yankees' Top Pick|work=New York Times|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|authorlink=Tyler Kepner|date=2007-08-17|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</ref>  The club also held options over Brackman for the 2011, 2012, and 2013 seasons which would have boosted the total value of his contract over $13 million if he met his bonus requirements.<ref name="NewYorkTimes" />  As specified by his contract, the Yankees placed Brackman on the 40 man roster.<ref name=CSTV.com/>

The Yankees recommended that he see [[James Andrews (physician)|Dr. James Andrews]] in Alabama to address his lingering elbow concerns.  Later in August 2007, he underwent [[Tommy John surgery]].<ref name=NewYorkPost/> Brackman began the 2008 season on the 60-day disabled list, a procedural move to keep him on the 40-man roster. Despite this setback, the Yankees still considered him a "blue-chip prospect".<ref name=NewYorkDailyNews>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/yankees/2008/02/26/2008-02-26_hank_steinbrenner_ill_look_at_big_pictur.html|title=Hank Steinbrenner: I'll look at big picture for Cashman contract talks|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|first=Mark|last=Feinsand|date=2008-02-26|accessdate=2008-02-27

==Pitching style==
At the time he was drafted by the Yankees, Brackman threw a 92 to 97&nbsp;mph [[fastball]]<ref name=draftreport>{{cite web|url=http://baseballexchange.wordpress.com/2007/06/10/draft-report-andrew-brackman-1st-round-30th-overall/ |title=Draft Report: Andrew Brackman |publisher=Baseballexchange.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref> that had touched 99&nbsp;mph.  He also has had a [[two-seam fastball]], [[knuckle curve]], and a [[changeup]] in his repertoire.<ref name=draftreport/>  His height and overhand action were cited by scouts as giving his pitches a desirable "downward plane".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/events/draft/y2007/drafttracker.jsp |title=The Official Site of Major League Baseball: Events: 2007 DraftTracker |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-21}}</ref>
