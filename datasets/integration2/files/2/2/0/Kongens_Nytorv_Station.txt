The station is located at the intersection of the M1/M2 and [[City Circle Line|M3/M4]] lines and is in fare zone 1. The station affords direct access to the [[Magasin du Nord]] department store.

[[File:Kongens Nytorv Station under jorden.JPG|thumb|left|160px|The escalators]] 
Kongens Nytorv is built and designed in the same style as other underground stations on the Copenhagen Metro. There are two main levels below ground level; the first is a few steps down from the street. At this level, passengers take an escalator down to a mezzanine switchback that makes them turn around and go down another escalator to reach platform level. There is also a lift that transports passengers to the platform. There are two entrances to the station as well: the southwestern corner of the intersection of Kongens Nytorv, Lille Kongensgade, Holmens Kanal, and Store Kongensgade and the other inside the Magasin du Nord department store.
