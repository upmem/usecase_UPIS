'''Brussels cheese''' ({{lang-fr|fromage de Bruxelles}} {{lang-nl|Brusselse kaas}}) is made from [[cow]]'s [[milk]] and is considered a table [[cheese]] that is used for spreading and snacks.  In texture it is smooth, with its taste being sharp and citrusy, with strong and salty bite. The cheese is regularly washed and dried over a period of at least three months, and is shaped into rounds or tubs.
