'''Tanapag Harbor''' ({{coord|15|13|36|N|145|44|12|E|}}) is the primary [[harbor]] of [[Saipan]], and is located on the western side of the island. It is separated from the [[Philippine Sea]] by a [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], located about 3&nbsp;km (2 miles) off the shore. This reef forms the Saipan Lagoon.

During [[World War II]] the harbor was occupied and used by [[Japan]] and later the [[United States]]. Following the war the harbor facilities have been significantly expanded to provide support for the [[United States Navy]].

This port is also called Puetton Tanapag, or the inner harbor.

The harbor should not be confused with the similarly named popular introductory SCUBA diving site at Tanapag Beach. [[Dive sites of saipan]]
