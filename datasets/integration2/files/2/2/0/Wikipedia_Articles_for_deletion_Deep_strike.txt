===[[Deep strike]]===
Contested Prod: "''Non-encyclopedic article: [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|Wikipedia is not a game guide]], and this article goes into far too much detail on a relatively minor point in the ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' game''". Prod removed, with the reasoning that with 100s of 40K articles in existence, very minor ones should stay. 

I'm bringing this to Afd, because the article is about a single game rule available for use by no more than two units from each army [[Codex (Warhammer 40,000)|Codex]]. Of the hundreds of 40k articles on wikipedia, this is the only one I've found dealing with a special game rule; most of the articles deal with the organisations, characters, and events of the fictional universe the game is based around. In addition, Wikipedia IS NOT [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information|an instruction manual]], for very very minor wargame rules or otherwise -- [[User:Saberwyn|Saberwyn]] 21:04, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
* '''Comment''': Isn't this an important aspect of the game? There seems to be a lot of google hits for something so minor [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Deep+strike%22+warhammer&spell=1]. Maybe it should be merged with the game. -- [[User:JJay|JJay]] 21:09, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
**This section of rules takes up less space in the rulebook than it does on Wikipedia (2 small paragraphs at most), is only available to a select number of units, and is is only legal in certain forms of gameplay. -- [[User:Saberwyn|Saberwyn]] 21:42, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' per original prod.  These are game instructions.  --[[User:Lockley|Lockley]] 21:20, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' per original prod (which for reference, I put on). This is not an important part of the Warhammer 40,000 universe. --[[User:Pak21|Pak21]] 22:23, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
