The result was '''Delete'''. While the article has sources, they are blogs and editorials. Could be redirected to a section of main dotcom bubble article. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:40, 5 November 2009 (UTC)'''

Article based on a two year old neologism , that predicts future events that never happened.  Entire article is based on two year old speculation from a few editorial writers.  [[User:Ridernyc|Ridernyc]] ([[User talk:Ridernyc|talk]]) 00:07, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - article (as at this writing) is founded on three independent reliable sources, is well sourced throughout and describes a notable concept.  (I could be talked into a Merge though if someone found an appropriate target.) - [[User:DustFormsWords|DustFormsWords]] ([[User talk:DustFormsWords|talk]]) 00:40, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
:If it's kept it's needs to be totally rewritten. [[User:Ridernyc|Ridernyc]] ([[User talk:Ridernyc|talk]]) 08:51, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' when did this happen? editorial writers aren't enough to make an article an encyclopedic topic. only a few here [[User:CynofGavuf|<font color="red">Cynof</font>]][[User talk:CynofGavuf|<font color="Yellow">G</font>]]<font color="Purple">avuf</font> 07:09, 28 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. This reads like an analysis, with points for and against the fact of the existance of the subject. I recommned that the sources be folded into [[Dot-com bubble]], and a small section be added that talks about the idea of a second such bubble - sort of like how a movie article will have a small section talking about a (possible) sequel. We can't very well talk about a subject if independent sources contradict each other about whether the subject exists.

*'''Strong Keep''' This article is notable.  I admit, it really ought to be shifted to the past tense, and it has a really long, unnecessary list at the end, but it is still a notable topic, cited in 3 independent, reliable sources.  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:S8333631|S8333631]] ([[User talk:S8333631|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/S8333631|contribs]]) 02:27, 29 October 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
*'''Delete''' Another interesting article.  However I don't think WP can have an article on something that may or may not exist (Okay [[UFO]] and [[Bigfoot]] are different).  In this case real people's lives and careers are affected. I'd like to see the information placed somewhere else, but I'm not sure how to do it. Maybe it could be snuck in at the end of the first [[Dot-com bubble]] article, in a section titled "changes in the market since the bubble" or something like that.
