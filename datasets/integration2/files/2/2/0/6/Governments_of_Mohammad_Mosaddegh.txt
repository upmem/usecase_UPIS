The premiership of [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] began when his first [[Cabinet of Iran|government]] was formed on 28 April 1951 and ended on 19 August 1953, when his second [[Cabinet of Iran|government]] was overthrown by the American–British backed [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup d'état]]. During the time, the two cabinets of Mosaddegh took control except for a brief period between 16 and 21 July 1952, in which [[Ahmad Qavam]] was the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]], taking office due to resignation of Mosaddegh from premiership and deposed by [[Mohammad Reza Shah|Shah]] after five days of mass demonstrations.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rahnema|first=Ali|authorlink=Ali Rahnema|year=2014|title=Behind the 1953 Coup in Iran: Thugs, Turncoats, Soldiers, and Spooks
