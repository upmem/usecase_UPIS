==Biography==
Marika Jakobovits (later Myriam  Yardeni) was born in [[Timișoara]], in the Romanian multiethnic region of [[Banat]], to a middle-class Jewish family.  In 1950,  she [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel. She studied [[Hebrew]] at [[Ulpan Etzion]] in [[Jerusalem]] and attended a pedagogical seminary founded by [[Martin Buber]]. At the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] she completed a BA in world history and French culture, and an MA in  history. Her master's thesis, written in 1961 under the guidance of [[Jacob Talmon]], explored the life and work of [[Bernard Lazare]], a French Jewish [[anarchist]] and [[journalist]]. In 1963, she wrote her doctorate at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] under [[Roland Mousnier]]. During her sojourn in Paris, she studied at the [[Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales]] (EHESS).
==Academic career==
At the urging of Haifa's mayor [[Abba Hushi]], Yardeni returned to Haifa and joined the faculty of the [[University of Haifa]]. In 1975, she was appointed head of the world history department. She  founded the university's institute for research of French history.

Yardeni's work focused on several research themes - national conscience in France in the  [[early modern]] period and religious minorities in French context, in particular [[Huguenots]] and [[Jews]]. She was interested in religious persecution and early modern [[anti-Semitism]]. Her extensive and innovative publications positioned her as one of the leading scholars in these fields.

Yardeni was a guest professor at [[CNRS]], [[Bordeaux University]], [[Michel de Montaigne]] Bordeaux3 University and the Institute for Science of Religion at the Haute Ecole de Hautes Etudes.
She retired in 2001, but continued to actively work on her research projects until her death. During these years Yardeni published several books and numerous articles, as well as participated in various conferences in Israel and abroad.
