The '''Athens Conservatoire''' ({{Lang-el|Ωδείο Αθηνών}}) is the oldest educational institution for the [[performing arts]] in modern [[Greece]]. It was founded in 1871 by the [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] "''Music and Drama Association''".

==History==
Initially, the musical instruments that were taught there were limited to the [[violin]] and the [[flute]], representative of the ancient Greek [[Apollonian]] and [[Dionysian]] aesthetic principles.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.documenta14.de/en/venues/868/athens-conservatoire-odeion-|title=Athens Conservatoire (Odeion)|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}</ref> Significantly, [[piano]] lessons were not included in the program. In 1881 its new [[Germany|German]]-taught  director [[George Nazos|Georgios Nazos]], in a move that was controversial at the time, expanded the conservatoire's program by introducing modern [[European classical music|Western European-style]] instruments and theory material.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.athensconservatoire.gr/%CF%89%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD/get-know-athens-conservatoire/|title=Get to know the Athens Conservatoire {{!}} ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|work=ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|access-date=2018-03-21|language=el-GR}}</ref>

Among the musicians who have taught at the Athens Conservatoire are [[Constantine Psachos]], [[Manolis Kalomiris]], [[Felix Petyrek]], [[Elvira de Hidalgo]]. Prominent personalities and artists who were taught at Athens Conservatoire include [[Spyridon Samaras]] (1875–1882), [[Maria Callas]] (1938), [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] (1919), [[Nikos Skalkottas]] (graduated 1920), [[Gina Bachauer]] (graduated 1929), [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]], [[Loukas Karytinos]].

The first [[Drama school|Drama School]] in Greece was also founded in 1871 on the premises, with many prominent theater personalities were included in its teaching staff, such as: [[Aimilios Veakis]], [[Dimitris Rontiris]], Kostas Mousouris, Dimitris Myrat and others.<ref name=":0" />

The institution also runs a Dance School which originated from the establishment of a rhythmic dance school in 1935, which however seized operations a few years after. The school reopened as a fully fledged Dance School in 2011 and in 2018 it gained an official professional accreditation status by the Greek Ministry of Culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.culture.gr/el/service/SitePages/view.aspx?iID=2601|title=Ανώτερες Σχολές Χορού|website=www.culture.gr|language=el-GR|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.athensconservatoire.gr/%CF%83%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%B4%CE%AD%CF%82/%CF%83%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%83/%CF%87%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83/|title=ΧΟΡΟΣ {{!}} ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|work=ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|access-date=2018-10-24|language=el-GR}}</ref>

Despotopoulos' complete proposal for the Athens Cultural Center involved remodeling the space that stretches from Vasilissis Sofias Avenue to Vasileos Konstantinou Avenue, and from Rigillis Street all the way to the [[National Gallery (Athens)|National Gallery]], spanning an area of nearly 150,000 square meters. According to Despotopoulos' archives on file at the Modern Greek Architecture section of the [[Benaki Museum]], in addition to the Athens Conservatoire, his plan foresaw the construction of an 1,800-seat opera house, a circular theater, an extension to the National Gallery, a new Byzantine Museum, a Byzantine-style church, a hotel, a hall for classical dance performances and the state orchestra, a playhouse for experimental theater, underground garages and more.<ref name=":1" />

A large part of the underground floors of the building was used to host the [[National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens]] (EMST), between September 2008 and May 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.emst.gr/en/museum|title=NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART, ATHENS (EMST)|last=DESIGN|first=i|work=EMST|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> The venue still hosts important events and cultural exhibitions<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greeknewsagenda.gr/index.php/topics/culture-society/6742-art-athina-2018-new-venue,-new-initiatives|title=Art Athina 2018: New venue, new initiatives|website=www.greeknewsagenda.gr|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> in Athens.

Since 2013 the Athens Conservatoire entered a new chapter<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/207659/article/ekathimerini/life/athens-conservatory-a-well-kept-urban-secret|title=Athens Conservatory: A well-kept urban secret, Margarita Pournara {{!}} Kathimerini|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref> with a series of renovations and the hosting of important cultural events. In 2016, a particular space, located in the first basement area of the building, was fully refurbished and used for the first time since construction, thanks to a generous donation from NEON Organisation, a cultural non-profit institution founded by the art collector and businessman [[Dimitris Daskalopoulos]]. The space, since named Polihoros Ω2,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.athensconservatoire.gr/%CF%89%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD/%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%87%CF%8E%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82-%CE%B5%CE%BA%CE%B4%CE%B7%CE%BB%CF%8E%CF%83%CE%B5%CF%89%CE%BD-%CF%892/|title=ΠΟΛΥΧΩΡΟΣ ΕΚΔΗΛΩΣΕΩΝ Ω2 {{!}} ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|work=ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|access-date=2018-10-24|language=el-GR}}</ref> is completely transformed into an exhibition space which also contains a small theatre stage<ref name=":2" /> and regularly hosts various cultural and artistic events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/ideascity-athens|title=IdeasCity Athens|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}</ref>

Between 8 April and 16 July 2017, the Athens Conservatoire was one of the four main partner venues of the [[documenta 14]] international art exhibition which was, for the first time in its history, hosted in Athens along with its main and original location in [[Kassel]], Germany. For the needs of the exhibition, most open public spaces inside and outside the building were dedicated to the artistic events, needs and exhibits of documenta 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frieze.com/article/documenta-14-athens-conservatoire|title=documenta 14: Athens Conservatoire|website=frieze.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://artsceneathens.com/2017/04/07/the-documenta-diaries-part-2-athens-conservatoire/|title=The documenta diaries: part 2 (Athens Conservatoire)|date=2017-04-07|work=Art Scene Athens|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chromart.org/documenta-14-learning-from-athens-part-iii/|title=documenta 14.

The space hosted a sound installation art project by the Nigerian artist [[Emeka Ogboh]] named ''The Way Earthly Things Are Going''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.documenta14.de/en/artists/11086/emeka-ogboh|title=Emeka Ogboh|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref> and was one of the rare occasions where the space has been open to the public.

In December 2017 the ''Aris Garoufalis'' Concert Hall, situated on the upper level of the building, was also completely renovated,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.andro.gr/empneusi/odio-athinon/|title=Η ανακαινισμένη αίθουσα Άρης Γαρουφαλής: Ακόμα μια ανάσα πολιτισμού στην Αθήνα {{!}} Andro|date=2018-01-12|work=Andro|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/athens-conservatoire-tense-architecture-network-atelier66|title=An architectural refresh of the Athens Conservatoire hits all the right notes|last=Magazine|first=Wallpaper*|date=2017-12-18|work=Wallpaper*|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> architecturally and acoustically, thanks to a donation by the ''Friends of Aliki Vatikioti for Music and the Arts'' Foundation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.athensconservatoire.gr/%CF%89%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%BD/arisgaroufalis/|title=Η ΝΕΑ ΑΙΘΟΥΣΑ ΣΥΝΑΥΛΙΩΝ "ΑΡΗΣ ΓΑΡΟΥΦΑΛΗΣ" {{!}} ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|work=ΩΔΕΙΟΝ ΑΘΗΝΩΝ|access-date=2018-10-24|language=el-GR}}</ref> The concert hall now regularly hosts concerts, music competitions, music exams, rehearsals and other cultural events.
