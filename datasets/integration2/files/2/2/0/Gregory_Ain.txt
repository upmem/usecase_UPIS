'''Gregory Ain''' (March 28, 1908&nbsp;– January 9, 1988) was an [[United States|American]] [[architect]] active in the mid-20th century. Working primarily in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] area, Ain is best known for bringing elements of [[modern architecture]] to lower- and medium-cost housing. He addressed "the common architectural problems of common people".<ref name=Denzer>{{cite book

[[Esther McCoy]] said "Ain was an idealist who gave the better part of ten years to combatting outmoded planning and building codes, and hoary real estate practices."<ref>[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-Ain--343437 Esther McCoy, "Gregory Ain" lecture manuscript (1982)]</ref>

== Biography ==

Born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], in 1908, Ain was raised in the [[Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles, California|Lincoln Heights]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. For a short time during his childhood, the Ain family lived at [[Llano del Rio]], an experimental [[collective farming]] colony in the [[Antelope Valley]] of California.

He was inspired to become an architect after visiting the [[Schindler House]] as a teenager. He attended the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC School of Architecture|School of Architecture]] in 1927–28, but dropped out after feeling limited by the school's [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]] training.

His primary influences were [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolph Schindler]] and [[Richard Neutra]]. He worked for Neutra from 1930 to 1935, along with fellow apprentice [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]], and contributed to Neutra's major projects of that period.

[[File:AvenelCooperative 2008 05 17 compressed.jpg|right|thumb|[[Avenel Cooperative Housing Project|Avenel Housing Group]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California]]]]

Following his collaborative relationship with Richard Neutra, in 1935 Ain cultivated an individual practice designing modest houses for working-class and middle class clients.

Ain was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1940 to study housing. During [[World War II]], Ain was Chief Engineer for [[Charles and Ray Eames]] in the development of their well-known leg-splints and plywood chairs, including the DCW and LCW series.

The 1930s and 1940s represented Ain's most productive period. During this period, his principled quest to address "the common architectural problems of common people", prompted the implementation of flexible floor plans and open kitchens. In the 1940s, he formed a partnership with Joseph Johnson and Alfred Day in order to design large housing tracts. Major projects of this period included Community Homes, Park Planned Homes, [[Avenel Cooperative Housing Project|Avenel Homes]], and Mar Vista Housing. The Gregory Ain Mar Vista Tract became L.A.’s first Modern historic district in 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gregory Ain {{!}} Los Angeles Conservancy|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/architects/gregory-ain|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.laconservancy.org}}</ref> He collaborated with landscape architect [[Garrett Eckbo]] on each of these projects. They were an expression of [[Mid-century modern]] design. Ain also practiced in a "loose partnership" with [[James H. Garrott|James Garrott]] for roughly 20 years, beginning in 1940.<ref>{{cite news

 }}</ref> They designed their own small office building together on Hyperion Avenue in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake neighborhood]]. Their projects attracted the attention of [[Philip Johnson]], the curator of architecture at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], who commissioned Ain to design and construct MoMA's second exhibition house in the museum's garden in 1950, following that of Marcel Breuer in 1949.<ref name="Denny">Denny, Phillip R. (August&nbsp;9, 2017).

In the late early 50s, Ain's practice was diminished as he was perceived as a communist.<ref name=Denzer/> For example, in 1949 he was listed by the [[California Senate Factfinding Subcommittee on Un-American Activities]] as "among the committee's most notorious critics."<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/reportofsenatefa1949cali#page/688/mode/2up Report of the Senate Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities (1949)]</ref> The growing "[[Red Scare]]" caused him to lose several opportunities, including participation in John Entenza's [[Case Study Houses|Case Study Program]].

Ain also taught architecture at USC after the war. Then, from 1963 to 1967, he served as the Dean of the [[Pennsylvania State University]] School of Architecture. He then returned to Los Angeles and died in 1988.<ref>{{Cite news
