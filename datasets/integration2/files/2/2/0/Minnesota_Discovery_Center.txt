==History==
The {{convert|660|acre|ha|adj=on}} museum complex opened in 1977 as the Iron Range Interpretive Center with 34 exhibits and was renamed in 1984 as Ironworld USA.<ref name="new name"/> In 2009 it became the Minnesota Discovery Center.<ref name="new name"/>

It was built to celebrate the immigrants who built Minnesota's Iron Range mining region, including [[Italians]], [[Finns]], and [[Yugoslavs]]. It was supposed to draw tourists from around the state and other parts of the U.S., but in the late 1990s was struggling to live up to attendance expectations.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&s_site=twincities&p_multi=SP&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB5E1A553A377CE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM AT AGE 20, IRONWORLD FALLS SHORT OF MANY EXPECTATIONS//IDENTITY CRISIS, POOR ATTENDANCE PLAGUE FACILITY]  May 19, 1997 - 5B METRO St. Paul Pioneer Press (MN)</ref>

Due to shifting ground on the property with [[shaft mining|mine shaft]]s beneath it, the tourist attraction faced a $2 million to $7 million cost in 2004 for filling and shoring up its foundation or to do complete reconstruction.  It is located on the old Glen Mine property where there are abandoned mine shafts.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NT&s_site=duluthsuperior&p_multi=DU&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1070F6DD88F640F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM IRONWORLD'S FUTURE IS ON SHAKY GROUND];  IRON RANGE: OFFICIALS DEBATE WHETHER TO STABILIZE THE SHIFTING EARTH BENEATH THE CENTER OR TO RELOCATE PART OF IT.

The Center include a 1920s [[tram|trolley]] that travels along a "picturesque" {{convert|2.4|mi|km|adj=on}} railway that winds around the Pillsbury mine pit and Glen mine disembarking at Wilpen Train Depot.  There is a renovated 1905 Hill's Finn Boarding House. There is also the Pellet Pete 19 hole mini-golf course. The Ironworld Museum has two floors of "exhibits about [[geology]], [[mining]], [[immigration]] and other aspects of the industrial and cultural history of the region," including the [[taconite]] mining process and the evolution of the industry on the Iron Range.<ref>Henrylito D.
