'''Dorothy Spencer''' (''[[née]]'' Sidney; later Smythe), '''Countess of Sunderland''' (5 October 1617 ([[Baptism|baptised]]) – 5 February 1684), was the wife of [[Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland]], and the daughter of [[Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester]], and [[Dorothy Sidney, Countess of Leicester|Lady Dorothy Percy]].

Lady Dorothy Sidney (or Sydney) was celebrated not only for her beauty but for wit, charm and intelligence. In about 1635, she rejected a marriage proposal from the poet [[Edmund Waller]], who addressed verses to her under the nickname "Sacharissa" (which he based on the Latin word ''sacharum'', meaning "sugar").

On 20 July 1639 at [[Ashburnham and Penhurst|Penhurst]], she married [[Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland|Henry Spencer]]. It seems to have been a love marriage and had her family's wholehearted approval. In 1643, Spencer was created 1st [[Earl of Sunderland]] in recognition of his service to King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in the [[English Civil War]]. Spencer was killed at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], leaving Dorothy with two children, and pregnant with a third, who died young. Their children were:

* [[Dorothy Saville, Viscountess Halifax|Lady Dorothy Spencer]]
* [[Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland]]
* Lady Penelope Spencer (c. 1642–1667), died unmarried.

The widowed countess lived at [[Brington, Northamptonshire]], but eventually returned to [[Penshurst Place]] in [[Kent]] to live with her parents. In 1652 she remarried to Sir Robert Smythe of [[Bidborough]], [[Kent]], and had a second son, also named Robert.

Her letters show both her intelligence and her clear-sightedness, even about those closest to her. While her son and daughter-in-law could see no fault in their eldest son, Robert, Lord Spencer, Dorothy wrote dryly of her grandson: "He has no good nature or humour, is scornful and pretending… comes to me seldom, seems weary in a minute, talks of my company [guests] as though I picked them up in the streets…".

Her death has been attributed to grief caused by her brother [[Algernon Sidney|Algernon]]'s trial and execution for [[treason]] in December 1683. Her grave is in [[Everdon]], [[Northamptonshire]].
