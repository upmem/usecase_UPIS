==Plot==
Publisher John Gillespie ([[Patric Knowles]]) faces a financial crisis after his business partner skips town with all the firm's assets.  Facing ruin, he reluctantly approaches a wealthy aunt for assistance but is met with a stony-faced refusal.  Returning home in a taxi, he finds a wallet containing £2,000 left behind by a previous passenger.  He takes the wallet, but rather than confiding in his wife he rents a room in which he secretes the money, telling her he needs the room for business purposes.

Shortly afterwards his aunt is found murdered, with her safe having been broken into and robbed.  Gillespie is the prime suspect, and wary of incriminating himself with regard to the £2,000 and unwilling to face having to surrender the cash, his story is deemed unsatisfactory and he is arrested and charged with murder.  However, a former employee of his aunt makes his own investigation into the case and discovers the real culprit.  Gillespie is released, then discovers he has been bequeathed a large sum of money in his aunt's will.  He can then return the wallet and the £2,000 to its rightful owner.
