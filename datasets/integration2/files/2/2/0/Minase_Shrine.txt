==Kanpei-sha==
In 1871, the {{nihongo|''Kanpei-sha''|官幣社}} identified the hierarchy of government-supported shrines most closely associated with the Imperial family.<ref name="imperial124">Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). ''The Imperial House of Japan,'' p. 124.</ref>  The ''kampeisha'' were shrines venerated by the imperial family.  This category encompasses those sanctuaries enshrining emperors, imperial family members, or meritorious retainers of the Imperial family.<ref name="system">Institute for Japanese Culture and Classics, Kokugakuin University: [http://www2.kokugakuin.ac.jp/ijcc/wp/glossary/def_K.html  Glossary of Shinto Names and Terms, ''Kampei Taisha.'']</ref>  Up through 1940, the mid-range of Imperial shrines or {{nihongo|''Kanpei-chūsha''|官幣中社}} included  the shrine; and it was then known as Minase''-gū''<ref name="imperial125">Ponsonby-Fane. ''Imperial,'' p. 125.</ref> In 1940, Minase's status was changed {{nihongo|''Kanpei-taisha''|官幣大社}}, which is the highest rank; and since then, it has been known as Minase ''jingū.''<ref>Ponsonby-Fane, Richard.
