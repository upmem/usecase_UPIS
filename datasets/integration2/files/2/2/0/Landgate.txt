The '''Western Australian Land Information Authority''' operates under the business name of '''Landgate'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www0.landgate.wa.gov.au/about-us |title=About us - Landgate |publisher=Landgate |access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref> Formerly the '''Department of Land Information''' ('''DLI'''), the '''Department of Land Administration''' ('''DOLA''') and the '''[[Department of Lands and Surveys, Western Australia|Department of Lands and Surveys]]''' ('''DOLS'''), it is the [[statutory authority]] responsible for [[property]] and land information in [[Western Australia]].

== Current activities ==
Landgate maintains the official register of land ownership and survey information for the 2,645,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of [[Western Australia]].

The authority provides a wide range of products and services such as Certificates of [[Title]], Property Sales Reports, Survey Plans, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], [[map]]s and [[data]], and are responsible for valuing the State's land and property for government purposes.

Landgate also provides consultancy services in the areas of survey, valuation (government only), international relations, pastoral and rangelands, and [[Native Title]]s.

In order to deliver these services and provide context to the Stateâ€™s property interests, Landgate coordinates access to location information held across WA government departments through the [[Western Australian Land Information System]] (WALIS). This information is made available through an [[open data]] platform called the [[Shared Location Information Platform]], or SLIP, which is accessed through the WA Government's open data website, [https://Data.wa.gov.au data.wa.gov.au] (DataWA). 

Landgate also manages the Capture WA program, which coordinates spatial imagery captures on behalf of all state and local government agencies in Western Australia in a bid to reduce costs and duplication.
