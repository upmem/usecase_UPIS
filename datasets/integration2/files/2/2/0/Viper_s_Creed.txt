==Plot==
With most of the Earth's cities underwater due to the [[Global warming|onset of global warming]] followed by a [[World war|third world war]] which brought calamity and turmoil to the people, [[Private military company|various PMCs]] are one of the few remaining organizations able to [[Law enforcement agency powers|provide law enforcement]] and [[Self-defense|self-defense protection]] for cities that are trying to rebuild again from the war and the floods.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201125601/http://www.animax.co.jp/10th/special/vc.php|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url=http://www.animax.co.jp/10th/special/vc.php|title=Official Animax Japan Viper's Creed summary|accessdate=2015-11-20|language=Japanese}}</ref> One of the PMCs [[Law enforcement agency powers|providing law enforcement]] is the Arqon Global Security corporation, responsible for protecting Fort Daiva City from terrorism, armed crimes, and renegade unmanned machines called Bug Mechs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animax.co.jp/feature/index.php?program=NN10000760|title=Official Animax Japan Viper's Creed Features Page|language=Japanese|accessdate=2009-02-27|publisher=[[Animax]]}}</ref> by deploying its elite military unit called Viper{{ref||Ep 02}} led by its operatives called Blademen.{{ref|E01|Ep 01}}

==Mecha==

===Maneuver Blades===
Maneuver Blades are humanoid mecha used by Blademen that are capable of transforming into motorcycles. These mecha are primarily armed with an assault rifle, a rocket launcher in each shoulder, and a 6-tube missile pod on the left shoulder. While in motorcycle form they can easily reach speeds over 80 kilometers an hour. Most maneuver blades are equipped with a secondary weapon depending on the combat tactics of the pilot including a grenade launcher attachment to the assault rifle, heat chainsaw, a gatling gun, or a sniper rifle. The head of the mecha also serves as cameras with highly detailed targeting scanners.

===Bug Mechs===
Bug Mechs are unmanned mecha based after insects that were used as autonomous war machines during the great war. However, due to their AI they became unable to differentiate between friend and foe and became very difficult to be reprogrammed. The bug mechs are usually armed with gatling guns and homing mines called Spider Mines or "Ticker Bombs" in which they use their spider-like legs to attach to enemies before exploding. As demonstrated in episodes 2 and 11, bug mechs are very versatile and can easily move around in dark and underground environments. Five types of bug mechs were used during the events of the series and with the exception of the sputnik every bug mech returns in the final episode by the military.

*'''Mega Soma''': Armed with twin gatling guns, ticker bombs, spider mines, and spear legs.
*'''Gelus''': Armed with twin gatling guns.
*'''Sputnik''': Armed with twin gatling guns and spear legs.
*'''Acromantis''': Armed with scythe arms, gatling gun, and spider mines.
*'''Mobilius''': Armed with spider mines, back missile pod, a left arm machine gun, and a right arm claw.
