Keisker is best remembered as the first person to record [[Elvis Presley]], on July 18, 1953. She was alone in the office of Sun Records, which also served as office for the Memphis Recording Service, when Presley came there to record two songs, "My Happiness" and "That's When Your Heartaches Begin", for a fee of $3.25. Her exchange with Presley on that occasion has since become part of Elvis lore: "I said, 'What kind of singer are you?' He said, 'I sing all kinds.' I said, 'Who do you sound like?' He said, 'I don't sound like nobody.'"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biwa.ne.jp/~presley/elnews-Q.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923191219/http://www.biwa.ne.jp/~presley/elnews-Q.htm |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
