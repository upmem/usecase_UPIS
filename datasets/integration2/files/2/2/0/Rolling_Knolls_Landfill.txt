The '''Rolling Knolls Landfill''' is a [[landfill]] located in the [[Green Village, New Jersey|Green Village]] section of [[Chatham Township, New Jersey|Chatham Township]] in [[New Jersey]]. It is bordered on two sides by the [[Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge]], and was formerly known as Miele's Dump, after owner Robert Miele.

The Landfill is notable for being identified by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] as a [[Superfund]] site. It was operated as a municipal landfill from the early 1930s until December 1968, during which time it handled [[municipal solid waste]], as well as construction and demolition debris from neighboring communities.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/nar1681.htm EPA]</ref>

"According to the EPA's Web site, soil samples collected in 1999 showed levels of metals, [[phthalates]], and [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) that were above regulation norms.

Mercury and PCB releases were also observed in a surface water and sediment sample taken from a portion of the landfill located within the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge, according to the EPA. Testing also showed "actual contamination of a terrestrial sensitive environment," and indicated potential exposure of nearby residents, the EPA says.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070607/UPDATES01/706070388 Daily Record]</ref>
