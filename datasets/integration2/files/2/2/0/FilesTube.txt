'''FilesTube''' was a [[metasearch engine]] that specialized in searching files in various [[file sharing]] and [[File hosting service|uploading services]], such as [[Mega (service)|Mega]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filestube.com/about.html|title=About FilesTube}}</ref> It also included sections for videos, games, lyrics and software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filestube.com/|title=The FilesTube homepage contains a bar at the top of the page used to categorize and search specific download types}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/jul/09/convenience-is-just-an-app-away/?entertainmentlifeentertainment|title=<nowiki>[FilesTube]</nowiki> is a dedicated search site to find downloadable files such as audio, video and documents}}</ref>

In December 2014, FilesTube discontinued its file-search service and became a free service for streaming licensed independent movies and series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filestube.com/about.html|title=About Us |last=|first=|date=|website=www.filestube.com|publisher=www.filestube.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230042111/http://www.filestube.com/about.html|archive-date=2014-12-30|accessdate=1 December 2014}}</ref>

As of July 2016, site redirects to viewster.com, site providing access to limited number of licensed content, including Anime and movies.

It is owned by Polish company [[Red-Sky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.red-sky.pl/show/25,filestube1/|title=English entry in Red-Sky's portfolio|access-date=2010-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613182833/http://en.red-sky.pl/show/25,filestube1|archive-date=2012-06-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Name and logo ==
[[File:Filestube old logo.gif|thumb|The old logo of FilesTube, showing a very close resemblance to [[YouTube]]'s logo.]]
The name and logo of the website are in the style of the video-sharing website [[YouTube]]. While the old logo looked almost identical to the YouTube logo (with "Files" replacing "You" and the logo colour being blue), slight changes have been made to the current logo.

== Reception ==
In 2010, Donnie Jenkins of ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' called the website "a dedicated search site to find downloadable files such as audio, video and documents".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2010/jul/09/convenience-is-just-an-app-away/?entertainmentlifeentertainment|title=Jenkins: Convenience is just an app away}}</ref>
