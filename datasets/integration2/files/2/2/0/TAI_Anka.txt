The '''TAI Anka''' is a family of [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAV) developed by [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI) for the requirements of the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. The basic Anka-A is classified as a [[Medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle|Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) UAV]]. Envisioned in the early 2000s for tactical surveillance and reconnaissance missions, the Anka has now evolved into a modular platform with [[synthetic aperture radar]], precise weapons and satellite communication. The drone is named after a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]-like mythological creature called ''[[Zumrud-u Anka|Zümrüd-ü Anka]]'' (''Anka kuşu'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-08|title=what do you know about Turkish drones|url=https://www.alsuleiman.net/archives/164|access-date=2020-11-13|website=علي السليمان Ali Al Suleiman|language=ar}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-01|title=طائرات بدون طيَّار.. هكذا فرضت تركيا قوَّتها في الجو|url=https://www.alsuleiman.net/archives/118|access-date=2020-11-13|website=علي السليمان Ali Al Suleiman|language=ar}}</ref>

The TUAV system consists of three air vehicles (A/V), Ground Control Station (GCS), Ground Data Terminal (GDT), Automatic Take-off, and Landing System (ATOLS), Transportable Image Exploitation System (TIES), Remote Video Terminal (RVT) and various Ground Support Equipment (GSE).

The TUAV system, which is designed for night and day missions including adverse weather conditions, performs real-time image intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, moving/stationery target detection, recognition, identification, and tracking missions.<ref name="TRDEFENCE">{{cite web|title=TAI Unveils ANKA Unmanned Airplane|url=http://www.trdefence.com/?p=1121|publisher=TRDefence|accessdate=20 July 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725200906/http://www.trdefence.com/?p=1121|archive-date=25 July 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

While the TUAV system has an [[open architecture]] to support other potential payloads and missions, within the context of the existing project the air vehicle is configured to carry the following payloads on board:<ref name="TAI">{{cite web|title=Turkish Indigenous MALE UAV (Anka)|url=https://www.tai.com.tr/en/product/anka-multi-role-isr-system|publisher=TAI|accessdate=29 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408093615/https://www.tai.com.tr/en/product/anka-multi-role-isr-system|archive-date=8 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

* Synthetic Aperture Radar/[[Ground Moving Target Indicator]] (SAR/GMTI)
* [[Inverse SAR]] (ISAR)

The whole composite airframe is composed of a monoblock fuselage, detachable wing and V-Tail, retractable landing gear, redundant control surfaces, avionics and payload bays and service doors. The sandwich skin structure is reinforced by composite or metallic frames, ribs, and supports. Propelled by a pusher type heavy fuel engine, the aircraft is furnished with fuselage fuel tanks and fuel system, ice protection system, environmental control system, lighting system, redundant electrical system with battery backup, and harness system.

The platform is also equipped with a digital flight control system, electro-mechanical actuators, and flight control sensor systems such as GPS, pitot-static, air data computer, navigation sensor, transducers, temperature, pressure, displacement sensors, etc.<ref name="ROCKWELL">{{cite web|title=Rockwell Collins selected to provide guidance and navigation system for Turkish Aerospace Industries' Anka Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|url=http://rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/News/2011_Cal_Yr/GS/FY11GSNR22-TAI_release.aspx|publisher=Rockwell Collins|accessdate=11 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826082007/http://rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/News/2011_Cal_Yr/GS/FY11GSNR22-TAI_release.aspx|archive-date=26 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> Various tasks are distributed along flight management computers and auxiliary control boxes. Identification and communication units and interface computers are employed in order to establish real time wide band communication and provide test and diagnostics functions. An air traffic radio is also integrated in the communication system for the integration of the aircraft into the civilian airspace. All flight critical equipment are dual or triple redundant and emergency modes of operational scenarios are taken into consideration for fail safe design.

All airborne and ground-based flight control software is developed by TAI while payload and other relevant hardware and software items are aimed to be developed by national sub-contractors, such as [https://www.aselsan.com.tr Aselsan], [https://www.ayesas.com AYESAS], and [http://www.milsoft.com.tr MilSOFT].

UAV operations are supported by highly sophisticated ground control system with complete redundancy, developed by a domestic defence company Savronik.<ref name="SAVRONIK">[http://www.savronik.com.tr/en/?defence-programs&07 Unmanned Air Vehicle Ground Control Station Shelter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325190055/http://www.savronik.com.tr/en/?defence-programs&07 |date=25 March 2012 }}, ''Savronik''. Retrieved 1 July 2011.</ref> Whole mission segments of the air vehicle can be managed, monitored and controlled by a GCS. A pre-programmed mission plan can be loaded before the flight begins or can be altered during the flight. All the imagery stream of the payloads can be displayed and recorded in real time and all the payloads can be controlled from the GCS. ATOLS allows the air vehicle to perform its operation without operator intervention, including the most critical phases which are landing and take-off.

In TIES, valuable intelligence information can be obtained by the analysis of bulky imagery data. TIES operators can initiate intelligence missions prior to or during flight. Refined information flows to the upper command layer in order to assist the headquarters to monitor a network of TUAV systems and benefit from the gathered intelligence information. Another interface of the TUAV system is the RVT, with which other friendly units who are close to the target area can utilize the real time imagery that TUAV air vehicle broadcasts.

===Anka +A===
On 19 July 2012, the Turkish Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSIK) announced that Turkish Aerospace Industries had commenced research and development for the design and development of a "hunter killer" High-Altitude Long-Endurance version of the Anka UAV, named the Anka +A. It was planned that Anka +A will carry Cirit missiles of Turkey's [[ROKETSAN]]. The engines of the Anka +A UCAV had not yet been determined. It might have more powerful turbo engines or it could have gas turbine engine.  The weight of Anka +A UCAV would be more than 4 tons compared to Anka Block A's 1.5 tons. It was highly expected that the UCAV would be presented to public in the events of IDEF'13 on 7–10 May 2013.<ref name="HDN">{{cite journal|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-set-to-produce-its-own-armed-uavs.aspx?pageID=238&nID=25830&NewsCatID=345|title=Turkey Set to Produce its own Armed UAVs|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720220220/http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-set-to-produce-its-own-armed-uavs.aspx?pageID=238&nID=25830&NewsCatID=345|archive-date=20 July 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="SUNDAYSZAMAN">{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=286926|title=Turkey to manufacture armed version of national drone|date=18 July 2012|publisher=Sunday's Zaman|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114040507/http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=286926|archive-date=14 January 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ZAMAN_02">[http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1321448&title=ankalar-silahlaniyor Zaman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723172803/http://www.zaman.com.tr/haber.do?haberno=1321448&title=ankalar-silahlaniyor |date=23 July 2012 }} Anka UAVs are getting armed</ref><ref name="YOUTUBE">{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwUeMD757e4|title=Anka MURAD BAYAR TRT AVAZ KANALINA KONUK OLDU|access-date=13 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617133247/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwUeMD757e4|archive-date=17 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:TAI-ANKA-UAV-FAR14-3659.JPG|thumb|Anka-B with SAR Radar]]
On 30 January 2015, the Anka-B completed its maiden flight successfully. Anka Block B is an improved version of the Anka Block A. The UAV carries an Aselsan synthetic aperture radar/ground moving-target indicator payload in addition to the platform's electro-optical/infrared sensor. During the maiden flight, Anka-B successfully performed "basic shakedown" and auto-landing. The Anka Block B also has a greater payload capacity than that of the Anka-A which includes SAR/ISAR/GMTI radar (in addition to the cameras of Anka A) that obtains and remits high resolution intelligence data back to base.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.trthaber.com/haber/bilim-teknik/yeni-nesil-anka-goklerde-165302.html |publisher=TRT News |title=Yeni nesil "ANKA" göklerde |date=30 January 2015 |access-date=1 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202022643/http://www.trthaber.com/haber/bilim-teknik/yeni-nesil-anka-goklerde-165302.html |archive-date=2 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.janes.com/article/48513/turkey-s-anka-block-b-uav-completes-maiden-flight |magazine=[[IHS Jane's Defence Weekly]] |title=Turkey's Anka Block-B UAV completes maiden flight |first=Lale |last=Sariibrahimoglu |date=30 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205023306/http://www.janes.com/article/48513/turkey-s-anka-block-b-uav-completes-maiden-flight |archive-date=5 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The Anka Block B paved the way for weaponisation of the platform in the foreseeable future.

=== Anka-S ===
[[File:TaiIDEF2015.JPG|thumb|Anka-S with modified radome for SATCOM]]
Anka-S is a serial production configuration of Anka. It is equipped with ViaSat's VR-18C Highpower [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] antenna and a national flight control computer. Like Block A and Block B, Anka-S will be powered by [[Thielert Centurion|Thielert Centurion 2.0S]]. On the other hand, Turkish Engine Industries (TEI) has been developing a national engine, capable of running with diesel and JP-8 jet fuel.

On 25 October 2013, Turkish Undersecretariat for Defence Industry (SSM) ordered 10 Anka-S UAVs and 12 ground control stations for $290 million ($220.6 million + TRY 137 million). The UAVs would be delivered in three batches (2+4+4). The first batch was planned to be delivered in March 2017. A total of 6 aircraft were planned to be delivered in 2017.

In 2016, media reported that the TAI was manufacturing 4 Anka-S UAVs for the armed forces. The first two of these aircraft were to be equipped with StarFIRE 380-HDL FLIR payload.

On 17 August 2018, Directorate for Defence Industries announced that the Anka-S completed its first live fire tests. The platform was tested with MAM-L ammunition developed by the Roketsan.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.janes.com/article/82468/satellite-controlled-anka-s-uav-fires-guided-munitions |magazine=[[IHS Jane's Defence Weekly]] |title=Satellite-controlled Anka-S UAV fires guided munitions |first=Lale |last=Sariibrahimoglu |date=20 August 2018 |access-date=29 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180930034204/https://www.janes.com/article/82468/satellite-controlled-anka-s-uav-fires-guided-munitions |archive-date=30 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> In September, Ismail Demir, director of the Turkey's defence industry authority, shared a picture of the first Anka-S equipped with Aselsan CATS optical system.<ref>https://twitter.com/IsmailDemirSSB/status/1044620673581285376</ref> TAI delivered 2 more Anka-S to [[Turkish Air Force]] in September 2018,<ref>https://twitter.com/SavunmaSanayii/status/1042381426493153280</ref> increasing the Anka-S inventory of Turkish Air Force to 8 aircraft. TAI is planning to deliver a total of 10 Anka-S to Turkish Air Force before 2019.<ref>https://twitter.com/Acemal71/status/1042393522974932992</ref>

In August 2018, the Anka-S carried out Turkey's "first satellite-controlled airstrike". In December, an Anka completed its first flight with an engine produced domestically. In 2019, the Anka broke its endurance records, flying longer than 24 hours.<ref name="Atomic"/>

Although Ankas have an operational range of about 100 miles, the Anka-S (satellite-enabled) is capable of flying beyond "line of sight".<ref name="Atomic"/>

=== Anka-I ===
Electronic warfare and intelligence UAV made for the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]]. Equipped with electronic warfare and intelligence systems (ELINT and COMINT).

=== Anka-2===

The Anka-2 (code name [[TAI Aksungur|Aksungur]]) is a twin engined version of the Anka-S which has a significantly higher payload capacity. This version is still under development and is planned to be taken into operation in 2020.

==Operational history==
The Anka performed its first mission flight on 5 February 2016 in Turkey's eastern province of [[Elazig province|Elazig]] performing a four-hour exploration and observation flight.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2016/02/07/turkish-drone-anka-makes-debut-flight/79973784/ Turkish Drone Anka Makes Debut Flight] - Defensenews.com, 7 February 2016</ref>

In the course of Turkey's [[Operation Olive Branch]] in 2018, the UAV for the first time used the Smart Micro Munition, [[MAM-L Smart Micro Munition|MAM-L]].<ref name="sabahdamage" />

Multiple Anka-S drones along with the advanced [[Bayraktar TB2]] drones were deployed and extensively used during the [[Operation Spring Shield]] launched by Turkey following the [[2020 Balyun airstrikes|heavy losses]] the Turkish forces incurred at the hands of the [[Russian military intervention in the Syrian Civil War|Russian-backed]] Syrian government in northwestern Syria at the end February 2020.<ref name="sabahdamage">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/business/defense/damage-caused-to-assad-regime-assets-demonstrates-turkeys-high-uav-capabilities |title=Damage caused to Assad regime assets demonstrates Turkey's high UAV capabilities |website=dailysabah.com|date=1 March 2020}}</ref> The deployment was assessed by experts to be a tactical game-changer.<ref name="sabahdamage" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.defenseworld.net/news/26447/Ten_Hezbollah__Syrian_Army_Commanders_Killed_in_Turkish_Drone_Strikes#.XmQdE6hKiUk|title=Ten Hezbollah, Syrian Army Commanders Killed in Turkish Drone Strikes|website=www.defenseworld.net|date=3 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/science-technology/turkey-s-drone-use-puts-forward-new-military-doctrine/1755210|title='Turkey's drone use puts forward new military doctrine |website=[[Anadolu Agency|aa.com.tr]]|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>
