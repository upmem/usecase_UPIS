I have tried a couple of times to make something of this article, but there are no reliable sources out there for this as an encyclopedic topic so something needs to be done. Food courts exist, but nobody appears yet to have produced a study of them. The problem is that without reliable sources the material tends to be original research, or an inappropriate synthesis of material gathered from varied sources.  I have attempted to merge it with [[Shopping_mall#Food_court]], but this has been undone. The term Food court has been transwikied to Wikitionary and the article was tagged either for a redirect, expansion or deletion. The tag was removed before any of these things happened -  I have replaced the tag. [[User:TexasAndroid]] put a Prod on it, but that was rejected. I suggested another attempt at a merge, but this also has been rejected. My feeling is still that a merge/redirect to Shopping Mall is the appropriate option. If the #Food court section manages to gain some reliable material to become a stand alone article then it can be broken out in [[Wikipedia:Summary style]], until that point it seems appropriate to keep it in the Shopping mall context where it makes more sense and is more likely to gain attention. The other option is to delete it, as there is already enough material on Food court in the Shopping Mall article to explain what it is: an area in a shopping mall that serves food. <span style="border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;">'''[[User:SilkTork|<font face="Script MT" color="#1111AA" size="2">SilkTork</font>]]''' *[[User talk:SilkTork|<sup>YES!</sup>]]</span> 19:20, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

*Since you aren't really trying to get this deleted, just merged and redirected, I think this is the wrong venue and I would suggest withdrawing the nom,   adding a merger tag to the page, and re-starting this discussion there. I'm not sure what you mean when you say the merger attempt was rejected, as I found no evidence of a merger discussion on the talk page. However, if you insist on going ahead with this AfD, my vote is '''Keep<s>/Merge</s>'''. The article has some sources cited, <s>but could probably be easily incorporated into [[Shopping Mall]]. </s> (changed per TPH's comment below) [[User:Beeblbrox|Beeblbrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblbrox|talk]]) 19:50, 3 July 2008 (UTC)

*'''Weak keep'''. Not all food courts are in shopping malls, so I don't think that's a valid target (there're food courts in gas stations and airports, sometimes even standalone food courts). Some of the sources are decent, and I'm sure there might be a way to improve the article.

*'''Strong keep''' A food court is certainly a notable subject. The only concern is the quality of the article, and that is not in and of itself a reason to delete. The article just needs to be developed. [[User:Eauhomme|Eauhomme]] ([[User talk:Eauhomme|talk]]) 00:54, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. I have started looking for sources and have found some. I will try to improve the article during the AfD period. --[[User:Metropolitan90|Metropolitan90]] [[User talk:Metropolitan90|(talk)]] 01:47, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - Their commonness makes them encyclopedic.  There are plenty of secondary sources on the topic.  Just a few seconds of googling brought up many articles by very reliable sources.[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADE101A10163C5&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM] [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D4E283BB5941&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM] [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/625428272.html?dids=625428272:625428272&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Sep+05%2C+1982&author=Gart+Washburn&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Food+courts+providing+slice+of+pie+to+all+in+modern+malls&pqatl=google]  [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB4225F3AF262A8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM].

*'''Keep''' per Eauhomme.  Quality is something that can be worked on, but the article is definitely a keeper.  [[User:SchuminWeb|SchuminWeb]] ([[User talk:SchuminWeb|Talk]]) 05:26, 4 July 2008 (UTC)
