'''Kluuvi''' ({{lang-sv|Gloet}}) is the commercial centre of [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], and a [[Subdivisions of Helsinki#Neighbourhoods|neighbourhood]] in the [[Vironniemi]] [[Subdivisions of Helsinki#Districts|district]] of Helsinki. The [[Helsinki Central railway station]], [[Hotel Kämp]], the Helsinki main post office, the [[Stockmann, Helsinki centre|Stockmann]] and [[Sokos]] [[department store]]s, the [[Kluuvi shopping centre]] and the main offices of Finnish banks are located in Kluuvi. Kluuvi includes the central campus of the [[University of Helsinki]], the [[Ateneum]] art museum, and the [[movie theatre]]s Maxim, [[Kinopalatsi]] and Bristol.

The neighbourhood is home to 23,000 jobs and several hundred inhabitants.

The official name of the neighbourhood is very seldom used in everyday speech, Helsinkians usually refer to the area as "the centre" (''keskusta'') or "the core centre" (''ydinkeskusta'').

==History==
The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''kluuvi'' and the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] word ''glo'' mean a [[gloe lake]] - a bay that is closed up or closing up. The district was originally a bay in the [[Gulf of Finland]], which eventually became swampy. The bay was filled in the middle of the 19th century. The odour of rotting [[seaweed]] and other plants can still be smelled near construction sites.
 
The [[Helsinki Metro]] construction found a ''kluuvi'' in the district, when it turned out the planned site for a metro tunnel was supposed to go didn't have a solid rock base. The soft ground had to be artificially frozen before it was possible to dig through it to construct a solid base for the metro track.
