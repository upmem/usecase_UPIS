==Plot==
Kiran ([[Kreshna]]) is a TV telemarketer who gets into trouble after one of his products has an opposite effect than what was intended, on the son of a local thug ([[Mahanadhi Shankar]]) who acted the commercial for him. That is also the moment when he discovers that his ‘real’ father left him a bungalow on an estate in a small town. He cons the son of the don, escapes with the money along with his girlfriend Smitha ([[Rupa Manjari]]), renovates the rundown mansion into a hotel with the help of a local caretaker named Sharath ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]), who was under the care of Kiran's father before and his bombshell sister Saranya ([[Oviya]]). Customers begin to come as soon the hotel was opened. A husband and wife, a newly married couple with relatives, and a bodybuilder die in the premise after staying for one night. The dead bodies are buried on the backyard. All the guests die except the schoolkids and teacher who were sent by the local police.

Baffled, Kiran tries to uncover the mystery behind the deaths, only to find the dead people were previous owner of the bungalow, which leads him to believe that the house is haunted. His suspicions are confirmed when things start going awry in the house, indicating some supernatural presence. They soon go to seek help from brother Adaikalam ([[Mayilsamy]]), who is a cheat. They kidnap him and bring him to the house. The foursome catch an old man inside the house, assuming that he is a thief. However, the old man says that he and the others will die if they leave the hotel. He narrates that the house was haunted by a ghost&nbsp;— Mohini ([[Anaswara Kumar]]), who would kill the house's owner.

Soon, the ghost starts to possess the people in the house and attacks Kiran. The gang is finally cornered with no chance of escape. It is said that they would die by midnight. Hearing someone banging on the door, Kiran opens the door to find the don, his son, and his thugs. The don asks for the house in return for the money he conned from him. Feeling pity for them, Kiran warns them about the spirit. Not listening to Kiran, the don forces him to sign the papers for the house. Kiran and his friends are let go, and they see the spirits of the previous owners on their way out. Just as they go out, they find the don and his thugs outside. Knowing that the ghost has killed the don's group since it is midnight, Kiran and his group walk away.
