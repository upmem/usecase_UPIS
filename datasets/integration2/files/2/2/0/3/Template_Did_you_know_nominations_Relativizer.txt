:* [[File:Symbol delete vote.svg|16px]] I'm afraid I can't accept this. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Relativizer&oldid=580535440 last diff before your expansion] returns a prose character size of 4913 bytes, which means you need to have expanded the prose beyond 24,565 bytes to quality. Unfortunately it's only 5014 bytes. Sorry.
