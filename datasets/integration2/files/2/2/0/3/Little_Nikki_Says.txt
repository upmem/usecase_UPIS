==Critical reception==
Maximum Pop said "'Little Nikki Says' is bursting with energy and raw talent, just like the UK starlett herself. It's got Little Nikki's usual edgy vibe with a chorus to die for. The track is also quite useful for those who are not too talented on the dancefloor, as Nikki gives some instructions on how to get down: "Little Nikki says put your hands up, up, up, up high/ Little Nikki says take your hips down, down, down, down low" but be careful, because if you don't do what Nikki says the track stops and an awesome siren-infused breakdown kicks in.",<ref name="maximum">{{cite web|url=http://www.maximumpop.co.uk/little-nikki-says/|title=Alarm Pop: Little Nikki - 'Little Nikki Says'|publisher=Maximum Pop|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref> while Lewis Corner of [[Digital Spy]] was less positive, saying "'Little Nikki Says' suffers from a tough case of hit and miss. "Little Nikki says, put your hands up, up, up, up, high/ Little Nikki says, take your hands down, down, round, down, low," she declares on a highly addictive chorus that is unfortunately sandwiched between clunky verses and whirring electronics that feel slightly disjointed. It's not a disaster by any means, but the jury is still out on whether this is enough to make her a household name."<ref name="digitalspy">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/review/a523659/little-nikki-little-nikki-says-single-review.html|title=Little Nikki: 'Little Nikki Says'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>
