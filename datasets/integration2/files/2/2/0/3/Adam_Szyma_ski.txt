'''Adam Szymański''' (15 July 1852 – 6 April 1916) was a Polish writer and lawyer, remembered for his ''Siberian Sketches'', detailed depictions of the life of Poles in exile. Pieces translated into English include "Srul from Lubartów", "A Pinch of Salt", and "Maciej the Mazur".

==Life==
He was born in [[Hruszniew]]. During the years 1872–1877, he attended high school in [[Siedlce]]. He studied law at the [[University of Warsaw]] in 1877. For his involvement with [[Adam Stanisław Sapieha]]'s "National Government" of 1877, and for helping [[Jan Ludwik Popławski]] to found the "Sons of the Fatherland", a socialist group presented as a patriotic version of [[Ludwik Waryński]]'s network, he was imprisoned in the Tenth Pavilion of the [[Warsaw Citadel]] in the years 1878–1879.

He was exiled to [[Siberia]], where he conducted geographical studies and ethnographic research into the [[Yakuts]]. At first he lived in [[Yakutsk]] and, from 1882, in [[Kirensk]] and [[Balagansk]]. After 1885, he was able to move to the European part of Russia beyond the borders of Poland. In the same year he became a member of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. He returned to Warsaw in 1895 and, from 1902, lived in [[Kraków]]. During the years 1904–1913, he edited the magazine "School Reform". He died in [[Moscow]] in 1916.

His wife was Nadezhda, with whom he had one son, Jan (1881–1953), who inherited his father's library.
