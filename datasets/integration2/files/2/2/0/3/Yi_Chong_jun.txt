== Life ==
Yi Chong-jun was born in 1939. He graduated with a degree in  [[German literature]] from [[Seoul National University]]. In 1965, he debuted with a short story titled ''Toewon'' (퇴원, lit. "Leaving the Hospital").<ref>{{cite web|title=Lee explores theme of utopia|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20111223000639|work=[[The Korea Herald]]|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=23 December 2011}}</ref> Two years later, he won a Dongin Literature Award for ''The Wounded'' (''Byeongsingwa Meojeori'', 병신과 머저리).

== Work ==
Yi is one of the foremost writers of the 4.19 Generation<ref>{{cite book |title=Korean Writers The Novelists |url=https://archive.org/details/koreanwritersnov0000unse |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Minumsa Press]]|chapter=Yi Chong-jun |year=2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/koreanwritersnov0000unse/page/236 236]}}</ref> and his literary output since has been both steady in pace and considerable in volume, and his subject matter has been varied. “The Wounded” (Byeongsin gwa mejeori, 1966) probes the spiritual malaise of the post-war Korean youth; This Paradise of Yours (Dangsindeurui cheonguk, 1976) explores the dialectics of charity and will to power, with the leper colony of [[Sorokdo|Sorokdo Island]] as the backdrop; and The Fire Worshipers (Bihwa milgyo, 1985) meditates on the meaning of human rituals conducted in a Godless society when no ultimate guarantee of the absolute can be given. Lee Cheong-jun's fiction encompasses a broad range of political, existential and metaphysical concerns.<ref>"Lee Chong-jun" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}</ref>

One of the recurrent themes in his fiction, however, has been the concern with language as a vehicle of truth. The Walls of Rumor (Somunui byeok, 1972) describes the ways in which freedom of speech was repressed in the ideologically charged atmosphere of Korean society in the era of national division. Stories contained in the collection In Search of Lost Words (Ireobeorin mareul chajaseo, 1981) continue the investigation of the effect of political violence on language. Because thought cannot be separate from the modes of its expression, distortions of language in a politically repressive society effect psychological damages as well. The tyranny of political and social systems as they become internalized in individual psyches?becomes inextricably bound to questions of language in?Lee Cheongjun's fiction.<ref>"Ma Jonggi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}</ref>

Another favorite theme is the role of art in life. Such early stories as “The Falconer” (Maejabi) and “The Target” (Gwanyeok) feature artisans dedicated to the perfection of their craft, often at the cost of conventional happiness. In more recent years,?Lee Cheongjun has drawn on forms of traditional folk art and the Korean spirit embodied in them as a source of inspiration. For example, the fictional work “Seopyeonje” (1993) foregrounds the genre of pansori, a traditional Korean oral performance which features a singer of tales accompanied by a single drummer. Here, artistic expression becomes both a mode of reconciliation to life, in spite of its countless woes, and ultimately of its transcendence. Made into a blockbuster feature film, “Seopyeonje” also helped revive great popular interest in the art of [[pansori]].<ref>"Ma Jonggi" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: {{cite web|url=http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do# |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055413/http://klti.or.kr/ke_04_03_011.do |archivedate=September 21, 2013 }}</ref>
