Edit patterns of both EMr KnG and Erim Turukku looks quite similar ([[WP:DUCK]]) - both users engage in category spams, overcategorizations, Turkic/Turkish POV, edit warring, etc... From my point of view, it's enough to see edit histories of EMr KnG ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?limit=50&tagfilter=&title=Special%3AContributions&contribs=user&target=EMr_KnG&namespace=&tagfilter=&year=2013&month=-1]) and Erim Turukku ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Erim_Turukku]) to get to the conclusion they are the same person. Also, [[User:Kansas Bear]] was the first to mention possible sock puppetry in this case, at Turukku's talk page. IMHO, this is a case of [[WP:SOCK]] without a doubt.

He was however appearantly {{possible}} to [[User:Madyas|Madyas]]. Madyas is another Turkic nationalist editor, who was blocked in February as per WP:NOTHERE and as a "likely sockpuppet". Curiously, suspected sock [[User:Gokhan Su|Gokhan Su]]'s only edit[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScythians&type=revision&diff=668731659&oldid=668441105] is to defend claims made at [[Talk:Scythians]] by Madyas.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AScythians&type=revision&diff=648104065&oldid=647123318] Sturanos is clearly the same person as Madyas. Compare Sturanos' recent edit at [[Nader Shah]][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nader_Shah&type=revision&diff=672610081&oldid=672151453] to an earlier edit by Madyas.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nader_Shah&type=revision&diff=649238998&oldid=648768398] A pattern of inserting "Turkic" into the infobox and intro of various articles, adding [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries]] to ''See also'' sections, and adding various "Turkic" templates and categories can be observed from the edits of Madyas (many more diffs can be provided if needed)[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Bulgarian_Empire&type=revision&diff=647086853&oldid=645346972][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qasim_Khanate&type=revision&diff=647086428&oldid=644089759][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khanate_of_Kokand&diff=prev&oldid=647077247][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Emirate_of_Bukhara&type=revision&diff=647086569&oldid=644767203][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khanate_of_Khiva&diff=prev&oldid=647078147][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khanate_of_Bukhara&diff=prev&oldid=647086223][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seljuq_dynasty&type=revision&diff=647086885&oldid=646896616][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kazakh_Khanate&type=revision&diff=647086918&oldid=643915064][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yueban&diff=prev&oldid=647096045][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wei_%28Dingling%29&diff=prev&oldid=647096303][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Turkic_Khaganate&diff=prev&oldid=647096622][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Western_Turkic_Khaganate&diff=prev&oldid=647096622][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Xueyantuo&diff=prev&oldid=647097187][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kangar_union&diff=prev&oldid=647097697][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Timurid_dynasty&diff=prev&oldid=647111200] and Sturanos.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saka&diff=prev&oldid=663052827][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saka&diff=prev&oldid=663056764][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saka&diff=prev&oldid=663067049][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avar_Khaganate&type=revision&diff=672625429&oldid=671047016][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Avar_Khaganate&diff=prev&oldid=672633478][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Qajar_dynasty&diff=prev&oldid=672626117] The same pattern can also be observed in the edits of [[User:Erim Turukku|Erim Turukku]] (more diffs can be provided if needed).[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=First_Bulgarian_Empire&diff=prev&oldid=579501755][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crimean_Khanate&diff=prev&oldid=579500966][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mongol_Empire&diff=prev&oldid=579502224][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hephthalite_Empire&diff=prev&oldid=579503487][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Khwarazmian_dynasty&diff=prev&oldid=579499955][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Golden_Horde&diff=prev&oldid=579500225] Erim Turukku is a [[WP:DUCK]]-blocked sock of [[User:EMr KnG|EMr KnG]].

A check against Gokhan Su, [[User:Wolfie87|Wolfie87]] and Dolatjan could however be helpful too.

The new user's edits are similar to sockpuppeteer. Also, he targeted same article just like before, some diffs:

The behavior of this new account is very similar to blocked sockmaster. For example same disruption on [[Template:History of the Turkic peoples pre-14th century]]. New accounts adds Turkish language to irrelevant articles just like the sockmaster. Similar edit summaries And he has same battleground behavior (reverting and ignoring edits by other editors). It's possible he registered multiple accounts again and uses them to evade block. [[User:Zyma|Zyma]] ([[User talk:Zyma|talk]]) 18:36, 25 January 2016 (UTC)

I would have to agree with Zyma.

He's indef-blocked by an admin due to his disruptive edits. And checkuser was rejected. So how to check his possible active accounts? Is it possible to find them or should I submit another SPI case? --[[User:Zyma|Zyma]] ([[User talk:Zyma|talk]]) 09:07, 26 January 2016 (UTC)

Same edits just like the previous blocked socks. New account [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmud_of_Ghazni&type=revision&diff=705445926&oldid=705102298], blocked sock [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mahmud_of_Ghazni&diff=701011027&oldid=698982541]. Either it's ex-sleeper account of sockmaster (now active) or he's one of those typical nationalist and disruptive editors. The behavior is similar to sockmaster, e.g. he targeted several Turkic and Turkey/Ottoman related articles and he returned to his favorite article [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] just after recent blocks (previous SPI report).
