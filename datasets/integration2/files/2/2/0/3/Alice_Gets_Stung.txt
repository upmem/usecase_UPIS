[[File:Alice Gets Stung.png|thumb|left|Julius and Alice threatened by a bear]]
[[Julius the Cat]] and Alice are hunting a wily rabbit, when they come across a bear, among other animals. Alice attempts to shoot the bear, but the bear ends up chasing them into a barrel. The bear then knocks a bee hive into the barrel (thus the "gets stung" in the title).
