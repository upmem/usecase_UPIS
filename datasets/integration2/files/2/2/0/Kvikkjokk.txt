==Climate==
Kvikkjokk has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfc''). It is one of the most continental climates of the Nordics, with {{convert|20|C|F}} summer highs and {{convert|-20|C|F}} winter lows in terms of averages. Areas to its north that share the proximity to the Norwegian border have greater maritime moderation with milder winters and quite a bit cooler summers. Kvikkjokk instead is quite reminiscent of Lapland's largest town [[Kiruna #Climate|Kiruna]] in terms of climate, only with wider temperature swings.
