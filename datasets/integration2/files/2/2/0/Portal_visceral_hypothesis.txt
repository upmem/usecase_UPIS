The '''portal-visceral hypothesis''' describes a possible mechanism for some of the health effects of [[obesity]], particularly the [[metabolic syndrome]].  It says that obesity (especially visceral obesity) results in increased circulation of [[free fatty acids]] and thus, via [[Randle's effect]], in [[insulin resistance]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Failure of fat cell proliferation, mitochondrial function and fat oxidation results in ectopic fat storage, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus|first1=L.|last1=Heilbronn|first2=S.

The word "portal" refers to the [[hepatic portal circulation]] from the digestive system to the liver.  The portal-visceral hypothesis is a replacement for the earlier "portal hypothesis", which said that visceral obesity leads to an increase in fatty acid levels specifically in the portal vein.
