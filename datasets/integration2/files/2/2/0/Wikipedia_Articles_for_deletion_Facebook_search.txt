This is almost an advert for Facebook, but Facebook doesn't need publicity! It is, however, a how to guide and an essay, neither of which have a place on Wikipedia [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 16:02, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' 80% of the article is a copyvio of http://www.facebook-search.com/about/, so I have gone the CSD route. If it survives speedy deletion with the removal of the copyvio, then the discussion here becomes one of notability (I do not view it as inherently notable). [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 16:14, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' At risk of making a fool of myself, I am now unsure whether this is anything to do with Facebook itself, or whether it is an independent website seeking to establish its own notability by placing a promotional article here.It appears to be http://www.facebook-search.com which could well be some third party utility page for Facebook. If so then this is blatant advertising as well as lack of notability. [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 16:42, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

*Yes, it's independent website and if you consider this as a blatant advertising, please, also delete following article too http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openbook_(Facebook).
:It describes similar website, but with restricted functionality comparing to Facebook Search website.
:Also I will remove part of article which duplicates http://www.facebook-search.com/about/
:Please, let me know if it's ok. Thank you.--[[User:DmitryO|DmitryO]] ([[User talk:DmitryO|talk]]) 17:54, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
**The other article you mention has coverage in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]]. This one does not. WIkipedia may not be used in order to establish a reputation. When that reputation is already established then an article is warranted. I am assuming that you have an intimate involvement with the site. It is unwise to create and edit articles where one has a conflict of interest. [[User:Timtrent|Fiddle Faddle]] ([[User talk:Timtrent|talk]]) 18:44, 1 August 2010 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' I don't like it [[User:Jimzah32|Jimzah32]] ([[User talk:Jimzah32|talk]]) 19:22, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
**That is definitely [[WP:IDONTLIKEIT|''not'' a good reason for deletion]] (although I do agree with a '''delete'''). It's hard to tell where this article is even going. '''Erpert''' <small>[[User talk:Erpert|(let's talk about it)]]</small> 06:20, 2 August 2010 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I'll tell it like it is; it's just a Google custom search set up with the term "[subject] +facebook" (it doesn't even touch the actual Facebook API). That's not the hallmark of a site at all, it's just a domain squatter trying to get Google AdSense dollars from poor suckers who didn't know you could do that right from Google itself. <font face="Myriad Web">'''[[User:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:maroon">Nate</span>]]''' <span style="color:dark blue">•</span> <small>''([[User_talk:Mrschimpf|<span style="color:dodgerblue">chatter</span>]])''</small></font> 19:31, 1 August 2010 (UTC)
**Now I look at the site more carefully, you are completely right. Damn, I wish I'd thought of that myself!!  On that basis, though my nomination for speedy deletion was declined, perhaps a passing admin might form a view that this is actually direct spam because using the page at all is likely to earn the site immediate Adsense revenue.
