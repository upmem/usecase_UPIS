Vintage TV broadcast a selection of music-related programming including [[music video]]s and [[concert]]s from an array of popular music artists primarily dating from the 1940s to 1990s. About 40% of its programming was original, including entertainment series and more than 500 specially created music videos featuring archive footage from the [[BBC]], [[ITN]], and [[Getty Images]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joinfreesat.co.uk/vintage-tv-set-for-freesat-launch|title=Vintage TV Set For Freesat Launch|publisher=Join Freesat|date=28 June 2010|access-date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307021517/http://www.joinfreesat.co.uk/vintage-tv-set-for-freesat-launch/|archive-date=7 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following a public vote from a list of 50 possible tracks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a266803/vintage-tv-to-support-music-charity.html|title=Vintage TV to support music charity|publisher=Digital Spy|date=24 August 2010|access-date=10 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608205556/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tech/news/a266803/vintage-tv-to-support-music-charity.html|archive-date=8 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> the first music video played on the channel was [[The Beach Boys]]' '[[Good Vibrations]]'.
