The poem was originally written in 1947 by the non-Native author [[Elliott Arnold]] in his [[Western (genre)|Western]] novel ''Blood Brother''. The novel features [[Apache]] culture, but the poem itself is an invention of the author's, and is not based on any traditions of the [[Apache]], [[Cherokee]] or any other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] culture.<ref>''Blood Brothers'', 1979, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HZwBDetIsrIC&pg=PP11&q=%22Apache%20wedding%22 introduction]: “There is no record of [Jeffords and an Apache girl] ever marrying, but… knowing the basically simple process of an Apache wedding, I have taken a writer’s liberty and imagined that such a wedding took place. The entire story of Jeffords and [the Apache girl] Sonseeahray is pure fiction and every detail of it was invented, against a known historical background.”</ref> The poem was popularized by the 1950 film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Broken Arrow (1950 film)|Broken Arrow]]'', scripted by [[Albert Maltz]], and the depiction of the marriage is criticized as a "Hollywood fantasy" ([[Hollywood Indian]] stereotype).<ref>Mead, [https://archive.org/details/oneperfectdaysel00mead/page/136 <!-- quote=hollywood. --> p. 136]</ref>

}}</ref> The poem is not associated with any particular [[religion]] (aside from being misrepresented as Native American) and does not mention a [[deity]] or include a petition, only a wish.

The 1950 film text begins "Now you will feel no rain" and ends "Go now. Ride the white horses to your secret place."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UxeZti4C_M Broken Arrow Full Movie 1950]</ref>

There are now numerous variations of the poem, generally based on the film, rather than the novel.<ref>Mead p. 136</ref> One modern form ends with "May happiness be your companion and your days together be good and long upon the earth."<ref name="falk"/>

==Criticism==

The ''[[Economist]],'' citing Rebecca Mead's book on American weddings,<ref>Rebecca Mead, ''One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding'', 2007, {{ISBN|1-59420-088-2}}</ref> characterized it as "'traditionalesque', commerce disguised as tradition".<ref>"American weddings: Beware the bridezilla monster", ''The Economist.'' May 26, 2007. Vol. 383, Issue 8530, p. 99. (A review of the book ''One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding.'' By Rebecca Mead. Penguin Press.)

The poem has gained even wider exposure as a series of [[Internet memes]], often accompanied by [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotypical depictions]] of [[Stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America |Native Americans]] depicted as [[Noble savage]]s. That it is continually misrepresented as Apache, Cherokee, or generic "Native American" is an example of both [[cultural appropriation|cultural misappropriation]] and modern [[fakelore]].
