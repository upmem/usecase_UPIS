The '''2009 [[R+L Carriers]] [[New Orleans Bowl]]''' was the ninth edition of the bowl.  The game was played at the [[Louisiana Superdome]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] on Sunday, December 20, [[2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2009]]. The game was televised live on [[ESPN]].  The [[2009 Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football team|Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders]], the [[2009 Sun Belt Conference football season|Sun Belt Conference]] runners-up, defeated the [[2009 Southern Miss Golden Eagles football team|Southern Miss Golden Eagles]], a team from [[2009 Conference USA football season|Conference USA]], by a score of 42–32.  The kickoff took place at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]].

Southern Miss returned to the New Orleans Bowl for the second straight season and faced one of the nation's hottest teams, Middle Tennessee.  Middle Tennessee reached nine wins for the first time since moving to the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] in 1999 and was on a six-game winning streak going into the game, also a team high in that span.  The New Orleans Bowl's [[Sun Belt Conference|Sun Belt]] slot typically goes to the conference champion, but [[2009 Troy Trojans football team|Troy]], who lost 30–27 to Southern Miss in the  [[2008 New Orleans Bowl]], played in the [[2010 GMAC Bowl|GMAC Bowl]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]], instead, opening the opportunity for Middle Tennessee. The bowl marked the Blue Raiders' second bowl appearance in four seasons.  Southern Miss was playing in their 12th bowl in 13 years. It was also the fourth time Southern Miss played in the New Orleans Bowl in the game's nine-year history.  They were  3–0 in New Orleans Bowl games before the loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4719464|title=Southern California Trojans to meet Boston College Eagles in Emerald Bowl}}</ref>  The game also marked the first meeting between the two schools.
