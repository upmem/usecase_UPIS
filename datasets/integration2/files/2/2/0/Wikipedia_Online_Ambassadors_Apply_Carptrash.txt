# Why do you want to be a Wikipedia Ambassador?
#: I have been touting wikipedia for years and after I convinced my father (age 90) that it was a worthwhile use of my time I discovered this program and decided to try it.
# In three sentences or less, summarize your involvement with Wikimedia projects.
#: I started out mostly creating and/or editing articles about American sculpture history or architectural history, branching out now and again onto mostly areas that I am interested in.  I have a large library at home and use it to reference edits, mostly my own, but also of other editors.  I have perhaps 2,000 articles on my watchlist  and check them for vandalism on a more-or-less daily basis.
# Please indicate a few articles to which you have made significant content contributions. (e.g. DYK, GA, FA, major revisions/expansions/copyedits).
#: [[Pioneer Woman]] a recent effort (with another editor), and my only known DYK.  [[Caspar Buberl]], an article I wrote, illustrated and consider to be the main source of information on this little known sculptor. [[Alexander Phimister Proctor]] an early effort that I need to get back to and make the citations inline.
# How have you been involved with welcoming and helping new users on Wikipedia?
#: I have a pretty standard blurb that i use when I run across an edit by a new editor whose user name appears in [[reddd|red ink]] suggesting that he/she put something on their user page and change their signature to [[blue]]. 
# What do you see as the most important ways we could welcome newcomers or help new users become active contributors?
#: Acknowledge their good faith efforts and encourage them to do more editing.
# Have you had major conflicts with other editors? Blocks or bans? Involvement in arbitration? Feel free to offer context, if necessary.
#: A few skirmishes.  I am currently just getting into a 3 revert situation at [[Espa√±ola, New Mexico]], but there is, I believe, no rancor involved, just a difference of opinion that will probably require outside input to resolve.
# How often do you edit Wikipedia and check in on ongoing discussions?  Will you be available regularly for at least two hours per week, in your role as a mentor?
#: I am pretty much a daily editor and do not see two hours a week as being a problem.  In fact it is what I think I am asking for.
# What else should we know about you that is relevant to being a Wikipedia Ambassador?
#: I have added a lot of images to wikipedia.  That is one of my loves. I also  have a bit of history in this sort of thing already,  here  http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.03/wiki.html and here  http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/digitalrevolution/2009/10/rushes-sequences-einar-kvaran.shtml

====Discussion====
:'''Strong support''' The thing that struck me is how calm and levelheaded you are during our exchange yesterday. Your photography is stunning (Are you a featured picture contributer?) and your writing looks good. --[[User:Guerillero|Guerillero]] &#124; [[User_talk:Guerillero|<font color="green">My Talk</font>]] &#124; [[Wikipedia:Editor review/Guerillero|<font color="Dark Orange">Review Me</font>]] 17:47, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
::Since I don't know what a "featured picture contributer" is I probably am not one. But thanks for the support.  [[User:Carptrash|Carptrash]] ([[User talk:Carptrash|talk]]) 20:00, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
