'''Dashtadem''' ({{lang-hy|Դաշտադեմ}}; formerly, '''Nerkin Talin''' (Note: The majority of residents in neighboring Talin still refer to Dashtadem as Nerkin Talin); Russified as '''Nizhniy Talin'''; both meaning "lower Talin") is a village located in the [[Aragatsotn Province]] of [[Armenia]]. The village contains the large [[Dashtadem Fortress]] dating to the 10th century but substantially rebuilt in the 19th century, along with a chapel dedicated to Saint Sargis also dating to the 10th century. The fortress keep has an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] dedicatory inscription of 1174, written in [[Kufic]] script attributing the structure to [[Sultan ibn Mahmud]] (Shahanshah), one of the [[Shaddadids]]. Past the village to the north just east of the road to [[Talin, Armenia|Talin]], and a few hundred meters before the electric substation (south), are the ruins of a large medieval [[caravanserai]]. Large sections of walls remain standing and the overall plan is still easily distinguished amongst the ruins. The remains of [[Stone Age]] obsidian workshops can be found on a hill to the west. In a cemetery south of Dashtadem, lies the restored 7th-century [[Kristapori Vank]].<ref name="Kiesling">{{cite book|last1=Kiesling |first1=Brady| first2=Raffi| last2= Kojian| year=2005 |title=Rediscovering Armenia: Guide| edition= 2nd| publisher=Matit Graphic Design Studio| location=Yerevan| pages=49-50| isbn=99941-0-121-8}}</ref><ref name="Holding">{{cite book|last=Holding |first=Deirdre |year=2014 |title=Armenia: with Nagorno Karabagh (Bradt Travel Guides)| edition= 4th| publisher=Globe Pequot Press| location=Guilford, Conn.| page=157| isbn=978-1-84162-555-3}}</ref>
