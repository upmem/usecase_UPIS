Obvious hoax. [[User:CrazyLegsKC|CrazyLegsKC]] 20:52, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

*'''Strong Delete''' per nom. Even if it were not a hoax, it is fancruft. Even if it were not cruft, it is completely written in-world for a fictional event. [[User:MKoltnow|MKoltnow]] 20:54, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Strong Delete''' Who are we kidding? It's a hoax. More accurately, its fan fiction, as any google search can tell you. [[User:W1k13rh3nry|W1k13rh3nry]] 21:12, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' as nonsense.  --[[User:Haemo|Haemo]] 21:17, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''', nonsense, unfortunately we still haven't got a speedy delete criterion for obvious hoaxes.  Too bad BJAODN has been wiped out.  [[User:Corvus cornix|Corvus cornix]] 21:54, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete A7''' sounds like a hoax [[User:Rackabello|Rackabello]] 22:04, 7 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''<s>Speedy</s> Delete''' It is a hoax which is obviously set in the [[Super Mario Bros.]] universe. Can't get any more fictional and nonsalvageable than that. [[User:Tinlinkin|Tinlinkin]] 04:27, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
*'''Comment''': Speedy declined. --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] 05:40, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
**Even though the article's premise and plot description was nonsensical, the article was written in a sensical way. That's nonsense. <small>(comment meant to be a joke, not a personal attack on the admin who declined the speedy deletion.)</small> [[User:Tinlinkin|Tinlinkin]] 06:14, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
