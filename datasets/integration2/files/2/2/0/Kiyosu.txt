==History==
Kiyosu was the location of a [[shukuba|post town]] ([[Kiyosu-juku]]) on the junction of the [[Nakasendō]] and the [[Minoji]] connecting [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] with [[Kyoto]] and the [[Ise Shrine]] during the [[Kamakura period]]. In the [[Muromachi period]], the area was fortified with the construction of [[Kiyosu Castle]], which subsequently became a stronghold of the [[Oda clan]] and the base from which [[Oda Nobunaga]] consolidated his control over [[Owari Province]] during the [[Sengoku period]]. After the start of the [[Edo period]], Kiyosu Castle was dismantled by order of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and most of the population relocated to [[Nagoya]]. By the start of the [[Meiji period]], the area was a rural area organized into villages within [[Nishikasugai District, Aichi|Nishikasugai District]] of Aichi Prefecture. The town of [[Kiyosu, Aichi (town)|Kiyosu]] was proclaimed on August 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system..

The city of Kiyosu was established on July 7, 2005 from the merger of the former town [[Kiyosu, Aichi (town)|Kiyosu]] with the towns of [[Shinkawa, Aichi|Shinkawa]] and [[Nishibiwajima, Aichi|Nishibiwajima]] (all from [[Nishikasugai District, Aichi|Nishikasugai District]]).

On October 1, 2009, the neighboring town of [[Haruhi, Aichi|Haruhi]] (also from [[Nishikasugai District, Aichi|Nishikasugai District]]) was merged into Kiyosu.<ref name="Plannedmerge">{{Cite web |url=http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/23.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728082555/http://www.kokudo.or.jp/new/cities/sub/chubu/23.htm |archive-date=2007-07-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
