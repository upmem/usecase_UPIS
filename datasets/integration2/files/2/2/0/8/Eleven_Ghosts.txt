The [[Allmusic]] review by Joslyn Layne stated "Supreme musicians Myra Melford and Han Bennink join together for a duo recording as blues progressions, boogie-woogie, and Harlem stride become the trampoline from which they jump. It's free, free, but far less cryptic -- and more accessible -- than one might expect. ... ''Eleven Ghosts'' won't scare the audience off. Even people who stiffen at the words "outside jazz" will relax their shoulders while listening to this album".<ref name="Allmusic">{{Allmusic|first=Joslyn |last=Layne |class=album |id=mw0000338909 |title= Myra Melford / Han Bennink: ''Eleven Ghosts'' – Review |accessdate=May 23, 2018}}</ref> 

In [[JazzTimes]], Bill Shoemaker wrote "On ''Eleven Ghosts'', pianist Myra Melford and percussionist Han Bennink bring complementary assets to a free-ranging duo program. Melford’s affinity for the blues and her compositional skills give the album a subtle structural underpinning. Bennink continually pushes the music to the brink with his patented combination of cyclonic energy and loony humor".<ref>Shoemaker, B.
