Article is recently created - But Celeris are not notable outside of the [[Virtual Pool]] series, which already has a comprehensive list of articles. If they had created other games, then, this would be ok. 

Article should be deleted/returned to redirect. '''[[User:Lee Vilenski|<span style="color:green">Lee Vilenski</span>]] <sup>([[User talk:Lee Vilenski|talk]] • [[Special:Contribs/Lee Vilenski|contribs]])</sup>''' 08:24, 24 May 2018 (UTC)

*'''Comment''': An [[Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2018_January_10#Celeris|RfD]] revolved around it producing another game, ''[[FlixMix]]''. But ''FlixMix'' is tagged for notability since July 2012, so the consensus here will revolve around that game's notability. –[[User:LaundryPizza03|'''<font color=#7f7fbf>Laundry</font><font color=#ffbf00>Pizza</font><font color=#bf0000>03</font>''']] ([[User talk:LaundryPizza03|<font color=#00df00>d</font>]][[Special:Contributions/LaundryPizza03|<font color=#00bfff>c&#x0304;</font>]]) 23:41, 29 May 2018 (UTC)
::Regardless of there being a second notable game that was created by the studio, that doesn't automatically make the studio themselves notable. There are a lot of non-notable studios that have produced lots of notable games, however, they are possibly notable for the [[Virtual Pool]] series, (and potentially [[FlixMix]]), but that doesn't make the studio themselves notable.

*'''Delete''' I was unable to find any significant coverage of the company itself. I lean against redirecting per [[WP:XY]] but I don't know if we really want to rehash the RfD. [[User:Winner 42|'''Winner 42''']]  [[User talk: Winner 42|Talk to me!]]  17:29, 8 June 2018 (UTC)
