Subject has received one apparently non-notable award (which was named after a notable person).  The link to the reference verifying this award, however, is nowhere to be found. Having publications does not make the author notable.  The Portuguese article has no additional sources in it.  If kept, the article should probably be trimmed down to what is known about her from reliable published sources (if any exist).  A Google search shows this Wikipedia article and the Portuguese one followed by hits like Facebook and Linkedin and then Whitepages and Spokeo listings along with other people with the same name.

*'''Delete''' not even close to being a notable writer.[[User:Johnpacklambert|John Pack Lambert]] ([[User talk:Johnpacklambert|talk]]) 02:02, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. The prize she won was presented by the president of the country [http://anibalcavacosilva.arquivo.presidencia.pt/?idc=22&idi=45629&idl=2] and covered by at least two major newspapers [https://www.dn.pt/artes/livros/interior/raquel-ochoa-e-a-primeira-vencedora--1443605.html] [https://www.dn.pt/artes/livros/interior/entrega-dos-premios-fernando-namora-e-agustina-bessa-luis-1621671.html] [https://www.publico.pt/2009/12/10/culturaipsilon/noticia/raquel-ochoa-e-primeira-vencedora-do-premio-agustina-bessaluis-1413265]. [https://www.noticiasmagazine.pt/2017/raquel-ochoa/ This magazine profile] looks in-depth and reliable. There's enough of a language barrier here to make it difficult for me to sift out reliably-published reviews of her other books from the usual books-for-sale web sites, but I suspect they exist as well. —[[User:David Eppstein|David Eppstein]] ([[User talk:David Eppstein|talk]]) 05:14, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': The prize she won is certainly highly respected in Portugal. She has been the subject of several reports in national Portuguese newspapers and there are at least two extensive interviews with her in Portuguese which can be accessed on the web.--[[User:Ipigott|Ipigott]] ([[User talk:Ipigott|talk]]) 06:51, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Keep''': She is an award winning author and there is extensive coverage of her in Portuguese press and meets the notability requirements. The article seems to have been largerly translated from the Portuguese entry which is where I think the dead link comes from. I will change the reference article about her winning the award from ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]''.[[User:Million Moments|Million_Moments]] ([[User talk:Million Moments|talk]]) 10:59, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per others: article needs work, but subject appears to meet the notability requirements. --<span style="font-family:Old English Text MT">[[User:Ser Amantio di Nicolao|Ser Amantio di Nicolao]]</span><sup>[[User_talk:Ser Amantio di Nicolao|''Che dicono a Signa?'']]</sup><sub>[[Special:Contribs/Ser Amantio di Nicolao|Lo dicono a Signa.]]</sub> 16:44, 26 May 2018 (UTC)

Sourcing in English is not a requirement for WP. [[User:SusunW|SusunW]] ([[User talk:SusunW|talk]]) 22:07, 26 May 2018 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' - She is a well known person in literary world and also an award winning author. Therefore the article passes notability guidelines. [[User:Abishe|Abishe]] ([[User talk:Abishe|talk]]) 06:09, 27 May 2018 (UTC)
