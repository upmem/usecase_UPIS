'''Hedgewar Smruti Mandir''' (HSM) is a memorial in Reshimbagh, [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra]], India dedicated to [[K. B. Hedgewar]] and [[M. S. Golwalkar]], who were the first two leaders of the [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] organisation [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS). It was inaugurated in 1962. It was granted tourism status on the recommendation of the [[Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation]] (MTDC) in 2017, but this decision is mired in controversy.

==History==

Hedgewar was the founder of the Hindu nationalist organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS); when he died in 1940, his final rites were performed at the RSS headquarters in Reshimbagh,<ref name="timesnownews">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/in-focus/article/nagpur-rss-founder-memorial-smruti-mandir-gets-tourism-status/225855|title=Nagpur: RSS founder’s memorial Smruti Mandir gets tourism status|last=|first=|date=8 May 2018|work=www.timesnownews.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref name="gradec">{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/smruti-mandir-gets-grade-c-tourism-status/articleshow/64055960.cms|title=Smruti Mandir gets grade-C tourism status|last1=Anparthi|first1=Anjaya|date=7 May 2018|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> and an unassuming [[samadhi]] (memorial) was built there.<ref name=Pioneer>{{cite book|last1=Bhishikara|first1=C P|title=Shri Guruji: Pioneer of a New Era|date=1999|publisher=Sahitya Sindhu Prakashana|isbn=9788186595169|page=165|language=en}}</ref> It was inaugurated on 9 April 1962 (Varsha Pratipada){{efn|The first day of the Indian national calendar.}} by M.

==Controversy over tourism status==
The [[Nagpur Municipal Corporation]] (NMC) approved money for the development of the memorial on 12 September 2017. The NMC has proposed construction of a road and a compound wall in Reshimbagh at a cost of {{INR}} 1.37 crore, but this is a controversial decision and has been contested.<ref name=nmdc/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nagpurtoday.in/amid-opposition-nmc-ayes-rs-1-37-cr-for-works-at-rss-owned-smruti-mandir/09130740|title=Amid opposition, NMC ayes Rs 1.37 cr for works at RSS-owned Smruti Mandir|last=|first=|date=13 September 2017|work=www.nagpurtoday.in|accessdate=24 May 2018}}</ref> A [[Public Interest Litigation|public interest litigation]] was filed to challenge this decision claiming that public money cannot be spent on the development of a private area.<ref name=xx/><ref name=yy/> Subsequently, it received a C-grade tourism status on the recommendation of the [[Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation]] (MTDC) and the district planning committee.<ref name=timesnownews/> The MTDC added the memorial to a list of places to visit in Nagpur Darshan for the large number of people visiting during [[Vijayadashami]] and other occasions.<ref name=gradec/> This decision by the MTDC is under court consideration because of the public interest litigation.
