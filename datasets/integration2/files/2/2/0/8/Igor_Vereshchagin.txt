'''Igor Evgenievich Vereshchagin''' (29 May 1952, in [[Kamensk-Uralskiy]]) is a Russian music and street photographer.

== Biography ==
Igor Vereshchagin was born on the 29 May 1952 in the town of [[Kamensk-Uralskiy]] of [[Sverdlovsk region]]. He graduated from the faculty of [[Radio-frequency engineering|radiotechnics]] of Tomsk Institute of Radioelectronics and Electronic Technology (nowadays [[Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radio-electronics]]).

After finishing his studies at the institute, Igor Vereshchagin worked for several years at the electronic computing machines center of the [[:ru:Братский алюминиевый завод|Bratsk Aluminum Plant]] and later became the chief of its photo service. At the same time, he started photographing for some newspapers and magazines, but his dream to photograph musicians and street scenes came true only after he had left for [[Moscow]].

=== Career ===
Igor Vereshchagin took his first photographs in 1957 when  he was 5. Since then photography has become the sole purpose of his life. At the age of 42 he moved to Moscow where he met [[:ru:Пилявин, Артур Вячеславович|Artur Pilavin]], a leader of the group “[[:ru:Квартал (группа)|The Kvartal]]”. The musicians of the group were the first that Vereshchagin began to take pictures of in the capital.

The photographer soon got acquainted with [[Garik Sukachov]], and took some photos of him by his own personal request at the MHAT ([[Moscow Art Theatre]]) concert on the 25th of October in 1996. Soon after the concert he received a new invitation and started working as an exclusive photographer for all of Sukachev's films: “[[:ru:Кризис среднего возраста (фильм)|The Crises of Middle Age]]” (1997), “[[:ru:Праздник (фильм, 2001)|The Holiday]]” (2001), “[[The House of the Sun (film)|The House of the Sun]]” (2010). This period becomes the start of Igor Vereshchagin's active work with both home-grown and world renowned stars.

The subjects of his photographs were [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Boris Grebenshchikov]], [[Elliot Erwitt]], [[Sebastiao Salgado]], [[Annie Leibovitz]], [[Olga Sviblova]], [[Boris Nemtzov]] and other remarkable people of our time.

On the 7th of June 2017, the famous photographer introduced, to the general public, his book “Given and Stolen” at the “Pioneer” movie theater. A special guest, a record producer from the [[Abbey Road Studios]], [[Haydn Bendall]], attended the event. The cult film from 1969, “[[More (1969 film)|More]]”, by a producer [[Barbet Schroeder]],  was also shown for the first time in Russia during this presentation.
