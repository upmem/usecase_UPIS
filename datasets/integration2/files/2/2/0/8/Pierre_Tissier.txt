In 1939 Tissier joined up and became a captain in the 1st Division of the Light [[Chasseurs Alpins]]. He headed up the 2nd Division of expeditionary French forces to Norway commanded by General [[Antoine Béthouart]]. After the evacuation in June 1940 he ended up in London and was the sole member of the Conseil d’État present in London. He thus became the first chief of staff of General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. As a consequence, the Vichy regime condemned Tissier to death in absentia for desertion. 
 
Tissier played a significant role in the [[Free French|Free France]] government in exile. In 1941 he drafted the statutes of the Free French government and acted as contrôleur de l'armée with the rank of lieutenant colonel. The following year he authored a semi-official publication in French and English with the title The Government of Vichy  (Le Gouvernement de Vichy).<ref> Renée Poznanski (2013) 'Voices from London on the Persecution of the Jews' in Gilespie and Webb (2013), ''Diasporas and Diplomacy'', Routledge pp79-81</ref>  In the same year he also published on the [[Riom Trial]].<ref>P.Tissier (1942) ''The Riom Trial'', G.G.
