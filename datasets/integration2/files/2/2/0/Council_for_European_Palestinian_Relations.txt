The '''Council for European Palestinian Relations''' (CEPR) is a [[Non-profit organization|not-for-profit organisation]] which advocates for Palestinians' rights in Europe. The organisation was banned in December 2013 from Israel by Defense Minister [[Moshe Ya’alon]], saying the organization serves as Hamas’ representative in Europe. The Israeli ban extends to the members of CEPR, that includes four European MPs.<ref name=Levinson>{{cite news |last=Levinson |first=Chaim|title=Defense Minister Ya'alon outlaws NGO representing Hamas in Europe|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.566342|accessdate=31 December 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>  Dr Arafat Shoukri, the director of the organisation, said that CEPR will take legal action against the Israeli decision.

The director of CEPR is [[Arafat Shoukri]], a resident of London. The organization is registered in [[Belgium]] and has offices in [[Brussels]] and [[London]]. 

==Aims and activities==
The CEPR is engaged in political [[lobbying]] work across [[Europe]], particularly the [[European Parliament|European]] and [[British Parliament]]s.

According to the CEPR's website, the aim of the CEPR’s work is to increase understanding of the Palestine issue and related [[Middle East]]ern issues in Europe and to increase dialogue between European, Arab and Middle Eastern politicians.

The CEPR focuses on taking parliamentary delegations to the Middle East while meeting with Hamas leadership in the area. In 2010, the CEPR was involved in taking a large number of European parliamentarians to the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Egypt]] on the anniversary of '[[Operation Cast Lead]]’. The delegation, the biggest ever to Gaza, was led by British Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] and included over 50 parliamentarians of 13 European countries. The visit included meetings with the [[United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East|United Nations Relief and Works Agency]] (UNRWA), Prime Minister [[Ismail Haniyeh]] of Hamas, Egyptian Foreign Minister [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] and Secretary General of the [[Arab League]] [[Amr Moussa]].

In October 2010, the CEPR took a delegation of parliamentarians from the European, British, [[Scottish Parliament|Scottish]] and [[Polish Parliament|Polish]] parliaments to the [[West Bank]] and [[Jordan]]. The trip included meetings with Hamas representatives in the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]] seeking sanctuary at the [[International Red Cross]], UNRWA Director [[John Ging]] and Jordanian Prime Minister [[Samir al-Rifai]] and Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh.

Between 6-9 February 2011 the CEPR was the co-organiser of a delegation of seven European parliamentarians to [[Lebanon]], where they met with senior government figures including President Suleiman and Prime Minister Designate Mikati and visited the Palestinian [[refugee camp]]s [[Bourj el-Barajneh]], [[Nahr al-Bared]] and [[Shatila refugee camp|Shatila]].

Following the [[popular uprising]] in Egypt in February 2011, the CEPR organised a delegation there to meet organisations likely to have a role to play in the forming of a new look Egyptian government and to engage with them on the issue of ending the blockade of the Gaza Strip. The CEPR has in the past held meetings with [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|EU High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy]] [[Javier Solana]], President of the European Parliament [[Jerzy Buzek]] and President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of [[Syria]].

The CEPR also prepares research briefs for parliamentarians and for download on their website.
