After a copyedit and a GA review, I believe this article successfully complies with FAC criteria. It is well written, contains references to reliable sources, and follows all style/image guidelines. Now, something bound to come up is the sources. Here's what I've got to defend them:
*http://blog.al.com/entertainment-press-register/2008/05/disney_animator_sees_summers_i.html is a press site for news related to [[Alabama]].
*http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ZEF33WPp4 and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9ZEF33WPp4 are internet talk shows hosted by internet personality [[Piper Reese]].
*http://www.resource411.com/411Update/Issue/Articles/Story.cfm?StoryID=1020 is a news website which is associated with [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]].
*http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3534&page=1 , http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3534&page=2 , and http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&category2=&article_no=3534&page=3 are e-zine versions of the popular animation website Animation News Network, which is referenced in countless [http://books.google.com/books?q=Animation%20World%20Network&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wp books]. 
*http://www.hopstudios.com/dtlink/listP.html is a website dedicated to alumni of [[University of Southern California]] and funds USC's official magazine, ''[[Daily Trojan]].'' 
*http://www.badmouth.net/comic-strip-war/ is a website co-published by award-winning writer John Marcotte and also features, as you can see from the article, Povenmire's official drawings.

*There are several '''good''' things about this article.  This is comprehensive, and reasonably well written, not brilliant, but sturdy (1a, 1b). It is neutral (1d), and seemingly stable (1e) (given the number of people telling him to change this and that, it's stable). The structure is good, lead is sufficiently "summary" style, and individual sections cover what they purport to cover (2a, 2b).  The info on "personal life could probably be integrated into the rest of the material, since it is so short, but based on [[WP:BLPNAME]], which is the Biography projects' policy on including names/info of minors and spouses, this is reasonable.  Images ''seem'' to be okay now, but that is not my bailiwick, and I'm not assessing those; it is sufficient for me to see a few images, and they are distributed to break up the text, and offer me an image to illustrate some point or other.  Although I would prefer an image of Phineas, for example, I suspect that falls outside "fair use."   The length is good, focused on the subject, no discursiveness (crit. 4). 
:*I could add [[:File:Phineas original sketch.jpg|this]] if you'd like, but, like you said, it's fairuse. '''[[User:SuperFlash101|<font color="006399">The Flash</font>]]''' <sup>[[User talk:SuperFlash101|<font color="black">{talk}</font>]]</sup> 18:33, 26 November 2009 (UTC)

*The remaining '''problems''' seem to be with reliability of the sources and citation styles (1c and 2c), which is a contention.  It seems to me that the sources are reliable within the realm of current popular culture, and it is perhaps unreasonable to expect a great deal of scholarly discussion of Sponge Bob Square Pants and Phineas and Ferb.  One hundred years from now, possibly.  But in 2009?  Not so much.  I've looked at the sources Flash has used.  As a scholar and historian I'm not ''happy'' with them, but as a reasonable and practical person I must admit they are not only what is available, they seem to be the best of what is available.  Is it reasonable to continue demanding specific kinds of sources that are not available for this topic?  Flash isn't writing about Milton or Rembrandt, for whom millions of trees have been destroyed, and gallons of ink expended.  So in fairness to Flash, I have to say he's met reliability requirements.  He did not cite gossip columns, and in most cases, he has two or three citations for the same assertion. Although I find this particular cite style extremely difficult to follow (a b c d etc.) this is not an actionable objection, just a personal preference; others find my cites equally objectionable.

::Specific examples that have raised issues:  The website Al.com.  This website appears to contain news articles from the Mobile Press Register.  It is their online presence, instead of using the newspaper name itself, which is where one goes to advertise, apply for a job, or subscribe.  So this is a choice that the newspaper made on how to present its material.  It is also an interactive website (hence the word "blog" I suppose).  The latest trend!  That is some 12-13 citations from an article on the subject. I've read the article from the paper and it is accurately presented in the wiki article.  ''Animation World'' magazine, while not a scholarly journal, nor a juried one, is still a central source for information about animation.  Again, see my comments above re the amount of literature available on this subject.  Four different articles are cited from that.  Okay, so these are not deep, intellectual stuff.  But again, the material is well represented in the wiki article. The newspaper articles look fine.  I've never been overly impressed with the Bergen Record, but they are reliable if not particularly inspired, and it was an interesting article. I have not got a clue what Badmouth is about, but the information in the wikiarticle does describe what is on the badmouth site (and cite). The last one is the Daily Trojan "Where are they now" list.  I read what was on there, and it looks like a class notes type of thing, ex officio.  The material Flash has cited is predominantly the personal information stuff--his house has a view of Mt Wilson (or ?), he married Vanessa,and his last DVD was released online.  Most of this is "flavor" for the article, gives a sense of the character of the LP, but of little substance, just rounds him out.  There is also a cartoon character on the site that is in the style Povenmire draws, so its quite possible that he sent the info in himself. AND wrote "over the hill" on his character's drum. Someone has a twisted sense of humor, and i like it.:) [[User:Auntieruth55|Auntieruth55]] ([[User talk:Auntieruth55|talk]]) 03:24, 2 December 2009 (UTC)

'''Oppose''' This a BLP and reliability of sources and ''how they are used'' to support statements in the text is paramount. I think this candidature was premature, and were it not for the efforts of Ealdgyth and Fifelfoo, it would have been quickly archived. That the nominator needed to defend the sources used in the nomination from the outset, immediately raised my doubts. One of Ealdgyth's concerns remains, and I agree with her on this.

:*Flash, while I don't think the Hop studio cite is problematic -- the data appears to be entered by alumni about themselves -- generally, these sources ''are'' problematic.  I suggest you take out the bits from Hop.  They are about the man's personal life, which is not related to his notability, and I've always been uncomfortable including data on his private life.  You can still include the info on his daughter ''sharing'' her name to a Phineas and Ferb character without having to cite Hop, because it's from somewhere else.
