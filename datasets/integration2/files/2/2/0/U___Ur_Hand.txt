"'''U + Ur Hand'''" is a song by American singer and songwriter [[Pink (singer)|Pink]]. It was lined up as the third single from her fourth studio album ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' (2006). It was released on August 28, 2006, and ignited controversy due to its explicit lyrical content and strong language.

The song was written by Pink, [[Max Martin]] and [[Dr. Luke]], the same trio who wrote Pink's previous hit single "[[Who Knew]]" and the song is also co-written by [[Rami Yacoub]]. The two songs eventually became Pink's first two singles to receive Platinum certifications from [[RIAA]], and the first two among a series of hits by Martin and Dr. Luke that followed, including Pink's first solo number-one hit on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]."

"U + Ur Hand" is credited for re-energizing Pink's career in the US and sales of ''I'm Not Dead'' in the country, as the album re-entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with the song's success, after weeks out of the chart. It peaked at number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Pink's seventh top-ten hit on the chart, and was ranked number 29 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2007|year-end chart for 2007]]. The single performed well internationally, peaking atop the radio charts of the Czech Republic and Hungary and reaching the top 10 in over 10 other countries.

==Writing and controversy==
Pink wrote the song with [[Max Martin]], [[Dr. Luke|Luke Gottwald]], and [[Rami Yacoub|Rami]] to mock the men who would flirt with her in clubs.  The title refers to the line "looks like it's just me and my hand tonight," which was a phrase she had heard guys using.<ref name="Making the Video 1"/>

The song caused controversy in the U.S. because of its "racy" references to [[masturbation]], and consequently some radio stations refused to play it.<ref name=ChicagoSunTimes/> Pink and her publicist further stated that she was prohibited from singing "U + Ur Hand" on the U.S. television show ''[[American Idol]]'' because of such references.<ref name=ChicagoSunTimes>Baldacci, Leslie.

Carraba said the single "is the vehicle that will reignite the U.S. marketplace. We think we have a number-one record on our hands."<ref name=Reuters/> One program director at the radio station [[WBBM-FM]] attributed the success of the single to its appeal to women, calling it "a female anthem" and "very fitting to people who are sick of getting hit on by guys at the club, and want to give them a nice buzz off ...
