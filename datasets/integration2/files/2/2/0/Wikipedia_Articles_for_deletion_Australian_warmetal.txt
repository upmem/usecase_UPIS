===[[Australian warmetal]]===
yet another bogus genre. Minimal number of bands, and a infrequently used term [[User:Spearhead|Spearhead]] 21:27, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom.[[User:Blnguyen|Blnguyen]] | [[User talk:Blnguyen|Have your say!!!]] 02:03, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Australian warmetal gets zero hits in a search of a Australian and New Zealand newspaper database and the bands listed are inconsequential in the Australian music scene. [[User:Capitalistroadster|Capitalistroadster]] 02:14, 29 March 2006 (UTC)
