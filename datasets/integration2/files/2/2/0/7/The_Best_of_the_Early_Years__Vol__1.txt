'''''The Best of the Early Years, Volume 1''''' is a compilation album by the American Funk band [[Funkadelic]]. It was released on [[Westbound Records|Westbound]] in 1977 while the label was distributed by [[Atlantic Records]]. ''The Best of the Early Years, Volume One'' compiles material from Funkadelic's tenure at Westbound from 1969 to 1974.

''The Best of the Early Years, Volume 1'' differs from the previous greatest hits compilation released by the label in the 1975 in that it features tracks that were not released as singles. Similar to the 1975 compilation, ''The Best of the Early Years, Volume 1'' has never been issued on CD, due to the fact that Westbound has released several compilations that were more comprehensive. It also consists strictly of album tracks, not edited single versions.

''The Best of the Early Years, Volume 1'' is the second [[P-Funk]] related release to feature artwork from illustrator Ronald "Stozo" Edwards.
