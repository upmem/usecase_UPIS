'''''Pterostylis elegans''''', commonly known as the '''elegant greenhood''', is a species of [[orchid]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[New South Wales]]. Non-flowering plants have a [[Rosette (botany)|rosette]] of leaves flat on the ground but flowering plants have a single translucent white and dark green flower with reddish-brown markings near the tip.

==Description==
''Pterostylis elegans'' is a terrestrial, [[Perennial plant|perennial]], [[deciduous]], [[Herbaceous plant|herb]] with an underground [[tuber]] and when not flowering, a rosette of between two and four leaves, each leaf {{convert|12-25|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10-15|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide. Flowering plants have a single flower {{convert|14-18|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6-8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide on a stem {{convert|150-280|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall with four or five stem leaves. The flower is translucent white with dark green lines and markings. The [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] sepal and [[petal]]s are fused, forming a hood or "galea" over the [[Column (botany)|column]] and which are reddish-brown near their ends. The dorsal sepal has a thread-like tip {{convert|5-8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long.  The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have erect thread-like tips {{convert|14-18|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long and a slightly protruding, notched [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] between their bases. The labellum is {{convert|8-11|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide, curved, dark brown and prominently protruding above the sinus. Flowering occurs from January to April.<ref name="Jones">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=David L.|title=A complete guide to native orchids of Australia including the island territories|date=2006|publisher=New Holland|location=Frenchs Forest, N.S.W.|isbn=978-1877069123|pages =288â€“289}}</ref><ref name="OEH">{{cite web|title=''Pterostylis elegans'' (a terrestrial orchid) - vulnerable species listing|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/PterostylisElegansVulSpListing.htm|publisher=New South Wales Government Office of Environment and Heritage|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>
