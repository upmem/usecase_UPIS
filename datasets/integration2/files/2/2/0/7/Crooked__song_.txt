== Writing and composition ==
"Crooked" was described as a "synthed-up, deliriously catchy [[pop-punk]]" with a "neon-bright" sound.<ref name="spin2"/> The track fuses "heavy drumbeats and [[metal guitar]] riffs",<ref name=Billboard>{{cite web | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/5680110/g-dragon-coup-detat-first-listen | title=G-Dragon, 'COUP D'ETAT': First Listen | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] | accessdate=September 6, 2013 | date=September 4, 2013 | last1=Benjamin| first1=Jeff| last2=Oak| first2=Jessica| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907215559/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/5680110/g-dragon-coup-detat-first-listen|archive-date=September 7, 2013}}</ref> besides featuring a "heavy [[bass line]] and fully amplified sound at the chorus."<ref name="hype"/> In the track, G-Dragon mixes rap with singing.<ref name=Billboard/> Lyrically, the single describes a man "full of angst and despair" that demands to be left alone as he spends the night "like a 'crooked-minded person,' because in the end, he's alone and doesn't need anyone's 'sugarcoated sympathy.'"<ref name=Billboard/>

The song's producer, Teddy Park, commented about the song's placement in the album, stating that "[W]e felt like the album had a lot of [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap music]], some [[R&B]] records, and some club tracks. But GD's like a punk rocker at the same time. He raps and shit, but he really loves that whole [[Punk subculture|punk attitude]]. So we needed a track that could express that."<ref name="Complex">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/09/g-dragon-coup-detat-making-of/crookedm |title=The Making of G-Dragon's "Coup D'Etat" |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=August 8, 2017 |date=September 10, 2013}}</ref>  Additionally, G-Dragon revealed that "Crooked" was "intended to make the audience go crazy during live shows", so the raps and chorus were made "to sound extra catchy so people could easily sing and dance to it."<ref name="Complex"/>
