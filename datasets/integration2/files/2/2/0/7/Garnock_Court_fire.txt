Four people were taken to [[University Hospital Crosshouse]], [[Kilmarnock]], suffering from the effects of smoke inhalation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12268601.Man_dies_in_tower_block_inferno/ |title=Man dies in tower block inferno (From HeraldScotland) |publisher=Heraldscotland.com |date= |accessdate=2017-06-27}}</ref>

The block was owned by [[North Ayrshire Council]], who ordered the precautionary removal of plastic cladding and PVC window frames.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> There was a Scottish select committee review that reported in January 2000, and this led to the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, which introduced the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 which came into force on 1 May 2005.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

This act includes this mandatory regulation:<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
<blockquote>Every building must be designed and constructed in such a way that in the event of an outbreak of fire within the building, or from an external source, the spread of fire on the external walls of the building is inhibited.</blockquote>
