====[[:Draft:Bye Bye Parabens]]====
:{{pagelinks|Draft:Bye Bye Parabens}}
Non-notable company, spammily praising "an international award winning celebrity master hair stylist" who owns the company, but is not celebrity enough to have any article or even redlinks here. No sources, no credible assertion of notability, and a creator who is apparently a freelance spammer (a/k/a undisclosed paid editor with a COI).

*'''Delete'''.  Either G11 or [[WP:TNT]].  Company, description, company website.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 03:33, 27 June 2017 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  The creator is suspected of editing while paid, without disclosure, he's not proven to be doing so - however, the article itself is still a pile of garbage which wouldn't pass even the most basic of tests of notability.  Needs to go. [[User:DaneGeld|<span style="font-family:Tahoma;color:red">Dane</span>]]&#124;[[User_talk:DaneGeld|<span style="font-family:Tahoma;color:#ffbf00">Geld</span>]] 20:55, 27 June 2017 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per above, though I think the undisclosed paid editing can be proven (as much as you can prove anything on the internet) per [[WP:COIN]].  [[User:Smallbones|Smallbones]]<sub>(<font color="cc6600">[[User talk:Smallbones|smalltalk]]</font>)</sub> 22:23, 27 June 2017 (UTC)
*'''Speedy delete''' per G11. [[User:VQuakr|VQuakr]] ([[User talk:VQuakr|talk]]) 07:49, 29 June 2017 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I probably wouldn't have G11'd at AFC, but would have left a G11 tag standing.  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] ([[User talk:Robert McClenon|talk]]) 00:52, 2 July 2017 (UTC)
