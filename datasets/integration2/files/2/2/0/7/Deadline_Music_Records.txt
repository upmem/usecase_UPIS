'''Deadline Music''' is a record sub-label wholly owned and operated by [[Cleopatra Records]]. Deadline was founded at the turn of the century during a revival of 1980s glam/[[hair metal]] bands in which there were new albums [[Quiet Riot]], [[White Lion]], [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]], [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]], [[Bret Michaels]], and [[L.A. Guns]]. The label produced a series of compilations, including ''This Is Hair Metal'', ''More '80s Hair Metal'', and the box set ''Hollywood Rocks!''.

Deadline released an album by [[Queensrÿche]] in April 2013. The band had split into two factions with founding vocalist/frontman [[Geoff Tate]] leading a new group of musicians while the remaining members carried on with a new vocalist. Dubbed "The Heaviest Rÿche Ever", Tate's version of the band included longtime guitarist Kelly Gray plus Quiet Riot bassist Rudy Sarzo and AC/DC drummer Simon Wright. This group recorded and released ''Frequency Unknown''. Los Angeles hard-rockers [[Bulletboys]] also released a new album, ''Elefanté'', in 2015

''Metal Avenger'', Thor's first album of new material for Deadline, arrived in 2016, and included guest appearances by [[Henry Rollins]], Fast Eddie Clarke, Cheetah Chrome, and Jay Jay French.

In 2016, Deadline released a deluxe box set by [[Twisted Sister]] consisting of previously unreleased live performances from the band's early days.

In 2018, Deadline released newcomers Kore Rozzik debut record "Vengeance Overdrive ". This marks the first new millennium artist for the label.
