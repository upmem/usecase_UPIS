This does not appear to be a notable website.  References (those that aren't dead links) are directory listings, non-independent (press releases), or merely niche publications.  There is nothing that amounts to the "significant coverage" required to meet [[WP:N]] or historical significance mentioned in [[WP:Notability (web)]].  The business currently linked at bonsoni.com is a housewares store and appears unrelated to the classified advertisement website described in this article.

*'''Comment''' I see launch publicity but no sustained coverage. I’m doubtful of some of the claims the article makes as Bonsoni just sounds like Craigslist. [[User:Mccapra|Mccapra]] ([[User talk:Mccapra|talk]]) 22:29, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' for the reasons above. [[User:Mccapra|Mccapra]] ([[User talk:Mccapra|talk]]) 08:59, 20 May 2019 (UTC)
