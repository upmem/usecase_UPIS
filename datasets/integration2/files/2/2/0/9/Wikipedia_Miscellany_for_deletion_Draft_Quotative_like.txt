The result of the discussion was:   '''merge''' to [[Like#As a colloquial quotative]]. [[User:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus]] ([[User talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk]], [[Special:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions]]) 07:59, 22 May 2019 (UTC)
====[[:Draft:Quotative like]]====
:{{pagelinks|Draft:Quotative like}}
The topic of this draft is already covered at [[Like]]. It would be best to copy the contents to the talk page for integration into the primary article. [[User:StudiesWorld|StudiesWorld]] ([[User talk:StudiesWorld|talk]]) 14:57, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
*'''Neutral''' - The reason given by the nominator isn't a reason for deletion, but it is true that this usage should be within the main article.  [[User:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon]] ([[User talk:Robert McClenon|talk]]) 15:27, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
*'''Merge and redirect''' to [[Like#As a colloquial quotative]], do not delete.  It is reasonable drafting of obviously suitable material, but it is accidental content forking.  The topic is covered in an article.  Edit that article directly, or us its talk page.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 23:35, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
*I still very much see the potential of a separate article on this subject, though I am not the one to write it. It would be a shame to see all of these citations go to waste, but other than that, the draft is unlikely to be developed into an article at this point. No particular opinions on this deletion nomination from me. A slight sadness to see it go unused, I suppose. ~[[User:Maplestrip|<span style="color:#005080">Maplestrip/Mable</span>]] ([[User talk:Maplestrip|<span style="color:#700090">chat</span>]]) 07:54, 14 May 2019 (UTC)
*Practically speaking, this will likely end up either getting G13'd or accepted.  My gut feeling is that there isn't enough content worthy of making a fork, so a merge would be the best way to go, but I could be wrong.

*'''Merge'''. [[Like#As a colloquial quotative]] is where this content belongs. The redirect [[Quotative like]] already exists. <span style="white-space:nowrap;">â€“ [[User:Levivich|Leviv]]<span style="display:inline-block;position:relative;transform:rotate(45deg);bottom:-.57em;">[[User Talk:Levivich|ich]]</span></span> 05:25, 22 May 2019 (UTC)
