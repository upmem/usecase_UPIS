==Reception==

Diwakar Pyakurel writes in ''OnlineKhabar''  that "the uniqueness of the setting is not the only strength of the movie. It presents a complex social drama on the universal theme of parental love beyond blood, but the narrative flow is so smooth and comprehensive that the audience easily understands the message" and gave it a rating of 3 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://english.onlinekhabar.com/appa-movie-review-this-nepali-indian-flick-tells-a-universal-story-in-its-own-style.html|title=Appa movie review|publisher=OnlineKhabar|accessdate=3 July 2019}}</ref> Rupak Risal of ''Moviemandu'' commended the "other love story [of the teenagers] within, good cinematography work and performances of the young actors" in the film but wrote what the film "lacks the most as a love story and drama is its scope. It doesn’t want to explore human hearts and excavate to the core to explore the human nature" and gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemandu.com/appa-movie-review/|title=Appa: Movie review|publisher=Moviemandu|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref> Gokarna Gautam of ''Nepal'' wrote that the film makes a honest attempt to explore the father-son relationship but does not reach the emotional depths required. The songs of the film are good but the plot is weak and gave the film a rating of 2 out of 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nepal.ekantipur.com/news/2019-06-28/20190628164441.html|title=Film samiksha: Appa|publisher=Nepal|accessdate=29 June 2019}}</ref>
