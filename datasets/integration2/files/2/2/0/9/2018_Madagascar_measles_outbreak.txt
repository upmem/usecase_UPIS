==Outbreak==
Measles cases were first detected in the urban, downtown district of Antananarivo-Renivohetra on 3 September 2018. At the time, health authorities were still heavily engaged in the remnants of last year's plague epidemic, and public resources were identified to tracking down remaining cases. On 4 October, the [[Pasteur Institute|Institute Pasteur]] de Madagascar confirmed the presence of [[measles morbillivirus]] in samples from 3 patients<ref name= reliefweb>{{cite web | url= https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2018-000417-mdg |title= Madagascar: Measles Outbreak - Oct 2018 |publisher= Relief Web |date= March 2019 |access-date= 13 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413080008/https://reliefweb.int/disaster/ep-2018-000417-mdg |archive-date=13 April 2020 }}</ref> and identified the B3 strain.<ref name= WHO>{{cite web| url= https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2019-measles-madagascar/en/ | title= Emergencies preparedness, response: Measles - Madagascar | publisher= World Health Organization | date= 17 January 2019 | access-date= 15 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191020060839/https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-january-2019-measles-madagascar/en/ |archive-date= 20 October 2019}}</ref> The virus had already spread outwards to the capital's Tanà South, Tanà North, Ambohidramito districts, and by 18 November there were over 3,200 recorded cases in Madagascar.<ref name= reliefweb/>

== Response ==
Measles immunity rates are below average in Madagascar at 83%, versus the 95% recommended by the [[World Health Organization]]. Availability of the [[MMR vaccine]] is patchy in Madagascar due to the island's mountainous geography, presenting a challenge to distributors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mensah|first=K.|last2=Heraud|first2=J.
