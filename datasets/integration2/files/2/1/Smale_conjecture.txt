{{short description|Theorem that the diffeomorphism group of the 3-sphere has the homotopy-type of O(4)}}
The '''Smale conjecture''', named after [[Stephen Smale]], is the statement that the [[diffeomorphism|diffeomorphism group]] of the [[3-sphere]] has the homotopy-type of its isometry group, the orthogonal group [[orthogonal group|O(4)]]. It was proved in 1983 by [[Allen Hatcher]].

== Equivalent statements ==

There are several equivalent statements of the Smale conjecture.  One is that the component of the unknot in the space of smooth embeddings of the circle in 3-space has the homotopy-type of the round circles, equivalently, [[orthogonal group|O(3)]].  Another equivalent statement is that the group of diffeomorphisms of the [[Ball (mathematics)|3-ball]] which restrict to the identity on the boundary is contractible.

== Higher dimensions ==
Sometimes also the (false) statement that the inclusion <math> O(n+1) \to \text{Dif}(S^n) </math> is a weak equivalence for all <math>n</math> is meant when referring to the Smale conjecture. For <math> n = 1 </math>, this is easy, for <math> n = 2 </math>, Smale proved it himself. 

Mostly by famous work of [[Michel Kervaire|Kervaire]] and [[John Milnor|Milnor]] on [[exotic sphere|exotic spheres]], it has long been known that this fails in all dimensions at least 5.

In late 2018, Tadayuki Watanabe released a preprint that proves the failure of Smale's conjecture in the remaining 4-dimensional case.<ref>{{cite web|title = Watanabe's proof of the failure of the 4-dimensional Smale conjecture|url=http://www.math.shimane-u.ac.jp/~tadayuki/Diff_S4.pdf}}</ref>
