The '''1828 United States presidential election in Louisiana''' took place between October 31 and December 2, 1828, as part of the [[1828 United States presidential election]]. Voters chose five representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|President]] and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].

[[Louisiana]] voted for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, [[Andrew Jackson]], over the [[National Republican Party|National Republican]] candidate, [[John Quincy Adams]]. Jackson won Louisiana by a margin of 6.02%.

In January 1828, Jackson had visited New Orleans to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in response to an invitation from the Louisiana legislature; he and his supporters financed the visit, as the legislature rejected providing any money,<ref name="parsons">Parsons, Lynn Hudson.  ''The birth of modern politics : Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the election of 1828''.  [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press|Oxford UP]], 2009.</ref>{{rp|147}} and lingering anger against Jackson's conduct in 1815 prompted the legislature to disclaim any adherence to Jackson as a political candidate.  The legislature remained dominated by Adams supporters.<ref name=parsons />{{rp|148}}  His supporters had a mixed record in the fall elections, winning the governor's mansion and the legislature but losing two seats in the federal House of Representatives.<ref name=parsons />{{rp|150}}  And while the presidential election ultimately saw Adams defeated in Louisiana, it was a slim defeat, in contrast to nearly unanimous support for Jackson throughout the other southern states.<ref name=parsons />{{rp|181}}
