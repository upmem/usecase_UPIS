:({{Find sources|Woolley Moor United F.C.}})
Per [[WP:FOOTY]], the team is not notable as it has not played at a high enough level of English football (i.e. level 10) nor has it played in the FA Cup or FA Vase. Initial PROD was contested at [[Wikipedia:REFUND#Woolley Moor United F.C.]] due to concerns that the club is notable as it is over 100 years old.

*'''Delete''' - no indication this club meets notability guidelines, no indication it has been the subject of independent coverage. <font face="Century Gothic">[[User:Cloudz679|C]][[:User talk:Cloudz679|<span style="color:#6A5ACD">679</span>]]</font> 21:00, 1 March 2013 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' They are level 14 at the moment looks like they are going to be level 13 next season. [http://thepyramid.info/asp/showclub.asp?clubname=Woolley_Moor_United]. However they must be FA registered club, [http://full-time.thefa.com/DisplayTeam.do;jsessionid=F0B96E16D2829967EDF7D2202EEA256B?teamID=9094245&divisionseason=3759050] Otherwise I am unable to find any history know, very little to help. But as I rule I rather not delete non-league clubs! [[User:Govvy|Govvy]] ([[User talk:Govvy|talk]]) 22:02, 1 March 2013 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' Consensus is that level 10 is the cut-off point as that is the level at which teams can enter the FA Cup. The fact that they could enter level 13 next year is therefore irrelevent, and even if level 13 were the cut-off point it would be [[WP:Crystal]] to keep the article. There are 970 clubs down to level 10, and some people argue that even that is too lenient. Down to level 13 is a further 2,500 clubs... It is very unusual for clubs this low down to pass [[WP:GNG]].
