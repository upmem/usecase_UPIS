Not a notable club. Not a professional team and does not meet [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:Walter Görlitz|Walter Görlitz]] ([[User talk:Walter Görlitz|talk]]) 16:34, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
*'''Weak Delete''' Holds training camps with clubs like Manchester United and AS Roma, and is obviously prestigious, but not really enough to push through [[WP:GNG]]. If someone could provide a list of players who played for the club and are now Tier-1 footballers who play in pro leagues and the list is substantual, it could pass in a similar way to [[Senrab F.C.]], but i can't even find one notable footballer who had association with the club.  <!-- Template:Unsigned --><small class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:JohnTombs48|JohnTombs48]] ([[User talk:JohnTombs48#top|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/JohnTombs48|contribs]]) 18:21, 9 October 2016 (UTC)</small> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->
