"'''The Town'''" is the third episode of the [[The Simpsons (season 28)|twenty-eighth season]] of the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the 599th episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on October 9, 2016.

In the episode, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] enrages [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] by becoming a fan of the Boston Americans (a parody of the [[New England Patriots]]). Homer takes the family on a "hate-cation" to [[Boston]] to show Bart how bad the city is, but the family fall in love with the city and move there. However, Bart soon discovers that Boston is not how he imagined it, and wants to go home.

"The Town" received positive reviews and was the most watched show on Fox that night, with an audience of 3.22 million. It was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program]].

==Plot==
Homer goes to Moe's Tavern to watch a football game between the Springfield Atoms and the Boston Americans, but they end up bitterly arguing with a group of Boston fans, calling their team cheaters and losers. Homer and the rest become enraged when the Americans win the game by throwing to their mascot, who was activated for the 53-man roster and reported in as an eligible receiver. Homer then says that he will lose his temper if he sees a Boston fan, but seconds later, he is surprised by a gleeful Bart wearing a Boston Americans cap as his son makes it plain he hates the hometown Atoms and loves Boston. Homer gets angry at Bart, but he decides to take him around Springfield to encourage him to cheer for the home team. Bart refuses and admits that people from Boston,  specifically [[South Boston|Southies]], are his people. Homer gets so traumatized that he decides to take the family on a "hate-cation" to Boston to show Bart what a terrible place it actually is.

During a visit to [[Faneuil Hall Marketplace]], Homer unsuccessfully attempts to provoke the Bostonians, when a cart full of [[bobblehead]]s fall on him. When he is helped by doctors, Marge is impressed with the Massachusetts health-care system, as much as Lisa is impressed by the [[MIT]] campus. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart go [[candlepin bowling]],  and when Homer learns that the player gets a third ball in this version of the sport, he falls in love with both it and the city. Homer gives up on the hate-cation and decides to enjoy Boston with Bart. Back at the hotel, Marge and Homer talk about their experience in Boston and decide to move to the town, declaring the move to be their "third ball".

The Simpsons rent an apartment and move all their possessions to Boston. Homer finds a job at the [[NECCO|NEKCO]] candy factory and Lisa enjoys attending the [[Combat Zone, Boston|Combat Zone]] [[Charter School]]. However, Bart realizes that he can no longer keep his reputation as a bad boy in school, as the children in detention focused their energy into ''[[a cappella]]'' singing, and that most of the town is made for intellectuals like Lisa. He decides to find a way to make the family move back to Springfield. Bart takes the family to the latest championship parade for the Americans, who used questionable tactics to win the crown. Homer tries to control his anger, but he gets enraged when asked to put on a Boston Americans' cap, ripping it into two and yelling that they are cheaters. The Simpsons then have to move back to Springfield, where Marge gets mad at Homer for making them lose that opportunity, but concludes that it would not have worked out for the family in Boston. Bart is now wearing a Springfield Atoms cap and Lisa is hallucinating about Boston.

==Production==
The episode was originally titled "Patriot Games", as seen in the script cover. However, the title was changed in January 2016 to "The Town".<ref>{{cite web|title= Chris Ledesma on Twitter - Name Change |url=https://twitter.com/mxedtr/status/774861096763072513|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=September 10, 2016|accessdate=October 10, 2016}}</ref> On [[Twitter]], producer [[Matt Selman]] posted a still image from a deleted scene, in which Bart rides a city bike.<ref>{{cite web|title= Matt Selman on Twitter - "The Town" deleted scene |url=https://twitter.com/mattselman/status/786718951141023744|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=October 13, 2016|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref>

"The Town" was rerun by Fox on February 12, 2017, a week after [[Super Bowl LI]], where the [[New England Patriots]] defeated the [[Atlanta Falcons]] 34–28 in the first ever Super Bowl game to enter overtime. As an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]], the final score of the Boston vs. Springfield football game was changed to reference the real-life result of Super Bowl LI. Selman explained that his team had proposed the idea whilst watching the game, having realized that "The Town" had been scheduled for a rerun the following week. Although the idea was a joke, [[Al Jean]] took it seriously.<ref name="bostoncom-simpsonsedit">{{cite web|title=A rerun of the all-Boston ‘Simpsons’ episode featured a new Super Bowl 51 Easter egg|url=https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/02/12/a-rerun-of-the-all-boston-simpsons-episode-featured-a-new-super-bowl-51-easter-egg|website=Boston.com|accessdate=13 February 2017}}</ref> He added that "jamming the Super Bowl teams and score into one shot makes no sense in the show, but we couldn't resist."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Simpsons: Boston episode rerun contained new Super Bowl LI easter egg|url=https://ew.com/tv/2017/02/13/the-simpsons-town-super-bowl-easter-egg/|date=February 13, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Dan Snierson|accessdate=February 13, 2017}}</ref> The edit was exclusive to this airing.<ref name="bostoncom-simpsonsedit"/>
