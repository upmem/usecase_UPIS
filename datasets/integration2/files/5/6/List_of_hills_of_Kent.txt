The table is colour-coded based on the classification or "listing" of the hill. The types that occur in [[Kent]] are [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]s, [[HuMP]]s and [[TuMP]]s, listings based on [[topographical prominence]]. "Prominence" correlates strongly with the subjective significance of a summit. Peaks with low prominences are either subsidiary tops of a higher summit or relatively insignificant independent summits. Peaks with high prominences tend to be the highest points around and likely to have extraordinary views. A Marilyn is a hill with a prominence of at least 150 metres or about 500 feet.<ref name="rhb">{{cite book|last=Dawson |first=Alan |year=1992 |title=The Relative Hills of Britain |url=http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ |publisher=Cicerone Press |location=Milnthorpe |isbn=1-85284-068-4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921045806/http://bubl.ac.uk/org/tacit/marilyns/ |archivedate=2010-09-21 }}</ref> A "HuMP" (the acronym comes from "'''Hu'''ndred '''M'''etre '''P'''rominence) is a hill with a prominence of at least 100 but less than 150 metres.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jackson |first=Mark |title=More Relative Hills of Britain |url=http://www.rhb.org.uk/humps/humps_1_1_0c.pdf |work=Relative Hills of Britain |accessdate=31 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012150300/http://www.rhb.org.uk/humps/humps_1_1_0c.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2013 }}</ref> In this table Marilyns are in beige and HuMPs in lilac. A "TuMP" as defined here is a hill with a prominence of at least 30 but less than 100 metres. The term "sub-Marilyn" or "sub-HuMP" is used, e.g. in the online ''Database of British and Irish Hills'' to indicate hills that fall just below the threshold. To qualify for inclusion, hills must either be 200 metres or higher with a prominence of at least 30 metres, below 200 metres with a prominence of at least 90 metres (the threshold for a sub-HuMP) or be in some other way notable. For further information see the [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles]] and the individual articles on [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]s, [[HuMP]]s, and [[TuMP]]s. In this context, "TuMP" is used to connote a hill with a prominence of at least 30 but less than 100 metres. By way of contrast, see also the article listing [[List of tumps|Tumps]] (a traditional term meaning a hillock, mound, barrow or tumulus).
