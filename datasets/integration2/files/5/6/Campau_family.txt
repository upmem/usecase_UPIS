Louis Campau (August 11, 1791 – April 13, 1871), sometimes spelled Campeau, was son of Louis Campau, Sr. He began working the fur trade as a boy for his father and his uncle, [[Joseph Campau]]. During the [[War of 1812]], he served under the [[United States Army]].<ref name="Gitlin p. 79"/> Campau was an important figure in the early settlement of two important [[Michigan]] cities. He established the first trading post at what is today [[Saginaw, Michigan]], as early as 1815. He played a key role in negotiating the [[Treaty of Saginaw]] in 1819 between Gen. [[Lewis Cass]] and Native American tribes of the Great Lakes region in which Native Americans ceded more than six million acres (24,000&nbsp;km²) in the central portion of the Lower Peninsula of the state.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

In 1826, Campau moved westward and established a trading post in what is today [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]. In 1831, he bought land for what is now the downtown business district of that city from the federal government for $90. Along with fellow pioneer [[Lucius Lyon]], Campau is remembered as one of the founding fathers of Grand Rapids.<ref name="HISTORY1870"/><ref name=Fued>{{cite news | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2012/12/feud_between_grand_rapids_foun.html | title=How a feud between the city's founding fathers shaped Monroe Center and downtown Grand Rapids|author=Garret Ellison | publisher=MLive Media Group | date=May 22, 2014 }}</ref><ref name=Statues>{{cite news | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2013/08/history_in_bronze_grand_rapids.html | title=History in bronze: Influential figures immortalized at 12 sites so far in Grand Rapids|author=Garret Ellison | publisher=MLive Media Group | date=August 11, 2013 }}</ref>

Cobmoosa led the [[Ojibwe]], of a band of the [[Odawa|Ottawa people]], in [[Ionia, Michigan]] and sold their crops to the initial settlers of Ionia in 1833.  He was also among those who went with [[Rix Robinson]] to negotiate a treaty for removal to Indian Territory, but he like other Ojibwe resisted that removal. In 1855 he signed a treaty with the federal government to relocate to [[Oceana County, Michigan]] in exchange for $540,000 in cash and goods.  The government built a log cabin for him in [[Cobmoosa, Michigan]] and he along with 1300 others were located by 1858.<ref>{{citation | author=Walter Romig | title=Michigan Place Names | page=123 }}</ref>
