This article fails [[WP:FICT]], [[WP:NOTE]] and [[WP:RS]]. Limited evidence of independent notability. I have attempted to expand the article in the past, but I could only find a single interview with an actor, and that is not enough to sustain the article.

*'''Merge''' or '''redirect''' to [[Bennett and Standish families]] or [[List of Passions characters and cast]]; he is mentioned in both places. [[User:J Milburn|Josh Milburn]] ([[User talk:J Milburn|talk]]) 18:05, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
:*I would recommend a redirect to [[Bennett and Standish families]] as the information about the subject is already located in that article rather than the list of characters and cast members of the show. [[User:Aoba47|Aoba47]] ([[User talk:Aoba47|talk]]) 16:46, 25 October 2016 (UTC)

*'''Redirect to [[Bennett and Standish families]]''' I think this is a better article for a redirect as opposed to the list article. [[Bennett and Standish families]] can be expanded as well. I prefer a redirect (with history preserved) instead of a merge here because the article is literally unsourced and it would be much better for someone to add sourced information to the target article. --[[User:Lemongirl942|Lemongirl942]] ([[User talk:Lemongirl942|talk]]) 07:53, 1 November 2016 (UTC)
