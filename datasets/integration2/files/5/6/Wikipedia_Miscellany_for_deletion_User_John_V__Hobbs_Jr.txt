*** Thank you.  This helps complete a picture of an expert who dabbled in contributing to Wikipedia, but didn't proceed very far.  The sandbox appears to represent an idea that he could provide expert contributions direct to Wikipedia.  Only a slight, and reasonable, misunderstanding of Wikipedia, but definitely a misunderstanding.
::: I like to think that we would all like educated people like this to return an be occasional contributors.  To that end, I have posted a welcome (I wish that all new accounts were auto-welcomed) on his talk page, and re-written his userpage.  Hopefully, he will return, read that, and maybe even edit one of the two pages linked.  That would be a good thing.  '''Keep''' as edited.  --[[User:SmokeyJoe|SmokeyJoe]] ([[User talk:SmokeyJoe|talk]]) 23:24, 9 October 2016 (UTC)
