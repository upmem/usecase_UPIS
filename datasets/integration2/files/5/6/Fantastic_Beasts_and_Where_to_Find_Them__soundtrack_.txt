==Background==
On 6 April 2016, it was announced that [[James Newton Howard]] would be composing the music for the film with veteran [[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]] director [[David Yates]] at the helm and [[J.K Rowling]] penning the screenplay.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levine |first1=Nick |title=‘Fantastic Beasts’: James Newton Howard to score JK Rowling’s ‘Harry Potter’ spin-off |url=https://www.nme.com/news/film/fantastic-beasts-james-newton-howard-to-score-jk-875743 |website=[[NME]] |publisher=BandLab Technologies |accessdate=September 7, 2019 |date=9 April 2016}}</ref> Howard stated that the film posed a "particular challenge" for him as it needed to be different and distinguishable from the previous Harry Potter films which saw iconic themes from acclaimed composer [[John Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lapin |first1=Andrew |title=James Newton Howard On Why ‘Fantastic Beasts’ Was So Hard to Score And Why He’s Going On Tour |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/07/james-newton-howard-interview-harry-potter-fantastic-beasts-1201849718/ |website=[[IndieWire]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |accessdate=September 7, 2019 |date=3 July 2017}}</ref> In an interview with [[Pottermore]], Howard stated that "it really is a balance of keeping the magic, the slight tension and the comedy. You don’t want it to be too much one way or the other. It’s always a balancing act between things like pace, character point of view, action and humour." Discussions with Yates, suggested that the music should feel "like we’re being invited into a grand adventure". 

Howard spent the majority of the time writing the themes at his piano for the main characters. For the character of Newt, he wrote two primary themes, a theme that displays Newt's warm personality and whimsicalness, and a theme for Newt's heroic actions which Howard calls "kind of the big, muscular hero theme". For Jacob, Howard crafted a tune that encompasses "lazy, bluesy 1920s quasi-jazzy kind". There were also themes for the creatures namely, the Erumpent, Demiguise and the Niffler.<ref>{{cite web |title=How composer James Newton Howard soundtracked Fantastic Beasts |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408015347/https://www.pottermore.com/news/interview-with-fantastic-beasts-composer-james-newton-howard |website=[[Pottermore]] |via=[[Wayback Machine]]|accessdate=October 1, 2020 |date=18 November 2016}}</ref>

The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[London]] with a 97-piece [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Pete Anthony, with orchestrations by Jeff Atmajian and Peter Boyer. The score was mixed by [[Shawn Murphy (sound engineer)|Shawn Murphy]].
