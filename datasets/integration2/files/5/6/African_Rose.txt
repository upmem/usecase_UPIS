'''African Rose''' (foaled 8 May 2005) is a British-bred, French-trained [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse and [[broodmare]]. She was bred and owned by [[Khalid ibn Abdullah|Khalid Abdullah]] and trained by [[Criquette Head-Maarek]].

As a juvenile in 2007 she showed very promising form, winning one minor race and being placed in the [[Prix Yacowlef]], [[Prix d'Aumale]] and [[Prix des Réservoirs]]. In 2008 she won the Listed [[Prix du Pont-Neuf]] and then showed improved form when dropped to sprint distances, finishing second in the [[Prix Maurice de Gheest]] before recording her biggest win in the [[Group races|Group One]] [[Haydock Sprint Cup|Ladbroke Sprint Cup]]. She remained in training in 2009 but failed to reproduce her best form and was well beaten in three races.

After her retirement from racing she became a broodmare and has had some success as a dam of winners.

==Racing career==
===2007: two-year-old season===
On her racecourse debut African Rose was matched against colts in the [[Prix Yacowlef]] over 1000 metres at [[Deauville Racecourse]] on 3 July. Ridden by [[Christophe Soumillon]] she finished second of the eight runners, two and a half [[Horse length|lengths]] behind the winner Stern Opinion. The filly was the moved up in distance for the Prix Vale over 1400 metres at [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] in August and recorded her first success, beating Aurore by three lengths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/252/clairefontaine/2007-08-03/441004|title=Prix Vale result |date=3 August 2007|work=[[Racing Post]]}}</ref> African Rose was then moved up in class and distance for the [[Group races|Group Three]] [[Prix d'Aumale]] over 1600 metres at [[Chantilly Racecourse]] in September ad finished third behind Top Toss and Mousse Au Chocolat. On her final appearance of the season African Rose finished third behind Gagnoa and Gipson Dessert in the [[Prix des Réservoirs]] at Deauville in October.

===2008: three-year-old season===
African Rose began her second season in the Prix Perruche Bleue over 1400 metres on [[Going (horse racing)|heavy ground]] at [[Saint-Cloud Racecourse]] on 22 April and finished third behind Destare and Belle Et Celebre. A month later the filly contested the Listed Prix du Pont-Neuf over the same distance at [[Longchamp Racecourse]]. Starting at odds of [[Fractional odds|2.6/1]] she took the lead 200 metres from the finish and "ran on strongly" to win by one and a half lengths from Salut L'Africain with the favourite Gipson Dessert in fourth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/211/longchamp/2008-05-22/459548|title=Prix du Pont-Neuf |publisher=Racing Post|date=22 May 2008}}</ref> In June over the same course and distance  she finished fourth behind Vertigineux, Chantra and Snow Key in the Group Three [[Prix de la Porte Maillot]]. African Rose was then dropped back in distance for the Group One [[Prix Maurice de Gheest]] over 1300 metres at Deauville in August. Starting a 17/1 outsider she took the lead 200 metres from the finish but was overtaken in the final strides and beaten into second place by the favourite [[Marchand d'Or]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/206/deauville/2008-08-10/464367|title=Prix Maurice de Gheest result |publisher=Racing Post|date=10 August 2008}}</ref>

African Rose was then sent to England for the Group One Ladbroke Sprint Cup. After the meeting at [[Haydock Park]] was abandoned the race was rescheduled and run at [[Doncaster Racecourse]] over six furlongs on 13 September. African Rose had spent a week in quarantine in the interim but appeared to suffer no ill effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/152198/african-rose-blooms-in-sprint-cup|title=African Rose Blooms in Sprint Cup|author=Mary Schweitzer|date=13 September 2008|work=[[The Blood-Horse]]}}</ref> She was made the 7/2 favourite ahead of the [[Aidan O'Brien]]-trained US Ranger, whilst the other thirteen runners included [[Reverence (horse)|Reverence]], Utmost Respect ([[Chipchase Stakes]]), Corrybrough ([[Scurry Stakes]]), Balthazaar's Gift ([[Critérium de Maisons-Laffitte]]), [[Astronomer Royal (horse)|Astronomer Royal]] ([[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]]), Diabolical ([[Alfred G Vanderbilt Handicap]]), Ancien Regime ([[Sprint Stakes]]), Assertive ([[Duke of York Stakes]]) and Wi Dud ([[Flying Childers Stakes]]). Pasquier restrained the filly towards the rear of the field on the stands-side (the right-hand side from the jockey's viewpoint) before making a forward move in the last quarter mile. She accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and held off a strong late challenge from Assertive to win by a neck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/15/doncaster/2008-09-13/461380|title=Ladbroke Sprint Cup result |publisher=Racing Post|date=13 September 2008}}</ref> Criquette Head said "It is fantastic. Doing what she has done, she has proved she is a good filly. She's tough and she can go anywhere now." whilst Pasquier commented "I am very happy. She's a good filly and although she was a bit excited before the race she showed a wonderful turn of foot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/doncaster-african-rose-cup-glory-for-african-rose/25073/#newsArchiveTabs=last7DaysNews|title=Cup glory for African Rose|author=Lewis Porteous|date=13 September 2008 |work=[[Racing Post]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

On her final appearance of the season she finished seventh of the eight runners behind [[Paco Boy]] in the [[Prix de la Forêt]] over 1400 metres at Longchamp in October, fading badly in the closing stages.

===2009: four-year-old season===
African Rose remained in training as a four-year-old in 2009 but made little impact in three races. She finished fourth to Tax Free in the [[Prix du Gros Chêne]] over 1000 metres at Chantilly in May, sixth behind [[Fleeting Spirit]] in the [[July Cup]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racingpost.com/results/174/newmarket-july/2009-07-10/481012|title=July Cup result|publisher=Racing Post|date=10 July 2009}}</ref> and eleventh to [[King's Apostle]] in the Prix Maurice de Gheest. African Rose [[EIPH|bled]] after the race and Criquette Head immediately announced the filly's retirement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racingpost.com/news/horse-racing/deauville-haydock-william-haggas-ryan-moore-african-rose-france-kings-apostle-strikes-in-prix-maurice-de-gheest/618366/#newsArchiveTabs=last7DaysNews|title=King's Apostle strikes in Prix Maurice De Gheest|author=Desmond Stoneham|date=9 August 2009|work=[[Racing Post]]}}{{dead link|date=October 2020|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>
