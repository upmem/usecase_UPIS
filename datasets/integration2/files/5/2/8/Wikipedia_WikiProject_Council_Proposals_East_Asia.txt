[[File:LocationEastAsia.PNG|thumb|East Asia]]
===Description===
This project would cover East Asia, one of the few regions of the world without a supranational coordination project. It would cover East Asian culture and civilization, transnational issues, relations between nations, historical nations of the area which are no longer extant. As there seem to be disputes between editors at [[WP:CHINA]], [[WP:JAPAN]], [[WP:KOREA]], [[WP:VIETNAM]], [[WP:TAIWAN]] on which article falls under whose wikiprojects' purview, this can also help with editors' animosities. The region covered under the project would be the [[Russian Far East]], parts of the Empire of China ceded by the Qing dynasty to Russia outside of the Russian Far East, [[Korea]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Mongolia]], [[Tibet]], [[Ryu Kyu]], [[Karafuto]]/[[Sahkalin]]/[[Kuril]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hainan]], [[Tonkin]] Basin of [[Vietnam]]/[[Annam (Chinese province)|Ancient Annam]], [[Kokang]]/[[Shan Plateau]] , [[East China Sea]] , [[Sea of Japan]] , [[South China Sea]] , [[Sea of Okhotsk]] , [[Gulf of Tonkin]]  [[Special:Contributions/76.66.193.224|76.66.193.224]] ([[User talk:76.66.193.224|talk]]) 08:24, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

===Discussion===

Mongolia is already covered by WikiProject Central Asia. [[User:Yaan|Yaan]] ([[User talk:Yaan|talk]]) 09:24, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::True, though Mongolia is also part of East Asia, and this proposal deals with issues in East Asia. Central Asia wikiproject would not necessarily deal that easily with the Russian/Chinese/Japanese confluence of influences on Mongolia in WWII, for instance; or Mongolian conquest of Manchuria.

::Would you prefer to take Mongolia out of scope? I don't really see a problem with overlapping scopes. [[Special:Contributions/76.66.193.224|76.66.193.224]] ([[User talk:76.66.193.224|talk]]) 04:56, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

:::I guess you are right about overlapping scopes. Maybe I just felt a bit argumentative. [[User:Yaan|Yaan]] ([[User talk:Yaan|talk]]) 16:41, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

: Similarly, Vietnam is also covered by [[WP:SEASIA|WikiProject Southeast Asia]]. --'''[[User:Dragfyre|dragfyre]]'''_<span style="font-size:70%">[[User_talk:Dragfyre|ʞןɐʇ]]</span><span style="font-size:70%;vertical-align:top">[[Special:Contributions/Dragfyre|c]]</span> 18:50, 7 June 2010 (UTC)

::True, though Vietnam is also part of East Asia, and this proposal deals with issues in East Asia. Further, CJKV shows the interrelationship between Vietnam and China/Korea/Japan. The scope is also restricted to northern Vietnam, the central highlands anc coast and southern delta are not covered. [[Special:Contributions/76.66.193.224|76.66.193.224]] ([[User talk:76.66.193.224|talk]]) 03:53, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

::Would you prefer to take Vietnam out of scope? I don't really see a problem with overlapping scopes; and one of the conflicts I've noticed is between Vietanamese and other East Asian editors who remove each other's WikiProject banners, because one thinks a topic is Vietnamese and not Chinese or Japanese, and vice versa. (Per the notice between CJKV,Taiwan - and nationalistic conflicts on whether banners of each project should exist or not on an article) [[Special:Contributions/76.66.193.224|76.66.193.224]] ([[User talk:76.66.193.224|talk]]) 04:56, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
:::I'm not particularly for or against; I guess I was just noting the overlap as [[User:Yaan|Yaan]] was, above. I think the East Asia WikiProject seems like a fine idea that would probably be quite beneficial to [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Disambiguation/CJKV task force|WP:CJKV]]; my own personal focus, though, is primarily within Southeast Asia, so I can't really say I could support this WikiProject in anything other than well-wishes. --'''[[User:Dragfyre|dragfyre]]'''_<span style="font-size:70%">[[User_talk:Dragfyre|ʞןɐʇ]]</span><span style="font-size:70%;vertical-align:top">[[Special:Contributions/Dragfyre|c]]</span> 15:52, 17 June 2010 (UTC)
There doesn't need to be any clear lines of demarcation here.  It can be decided on a case-by-case basis whether or not an article should be supported by this WikiProject.

::Already [[WikiProject Southeast Asia]] exists - so any of the boundary issues can be worked out with that relatively quiet project anyways - currently Vietnam and Philippines are countries included in the Southeast Asia project - assuming that anything north of eiher is in the eastern asia project - unless negotiated [[User:SatuSuro|Satu]][[User talk:SatuSuro|Suro]] 13:58, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
