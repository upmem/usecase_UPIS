===Description===
This project would cover North America, one of the few regions of the world without a supranational coordination wikiproject. It would cover [[Canada]], [[USA]] (lower 48+DC and Alaska), [[Mexico]], [[Greenland]], [[Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[Grand Banks]], [[Georges Bank]], [[Laurentian Abyss]], continental shelf (not on the Caribbean Plate, outside of Russia). The southern island nations are already covered by [[WP:Caribbean]], so are not included, nor the nations of Central American which already are covered by [[WP:Central America]]. This would ease issues with pre-national-existencearticles that covered areas across borders, and for histories of regions prior to their incorporation into these nations.

#Way too big to be effective. US articles would take over the project, if the scope was more limited with the idea of merging existing small Country projects and covering previously uncovered areas, sure. [[User:Sadads|Sadads]] ([[User talk:Sadads|talk]]) 09:14, 23 July 2010 (UTC)
#: I'm assuming the nominator intended the Project to cover "top-level" articles such as countries, states, provinces, rather than counties, villages, towns, cities, etc. Perhaps clarification of the scope is needed in the discussion section below. <small><span style="border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;">[[User:Matthewedwards|<b>Matthewedwards</b>]] : [[User_talk:Matthewedwards|<font style="color:#accC10;background:#0000fa;">&nbsp;Chat&nbsp;</font>]] </span></small> 15:51, 23 July 2010 (UTC)
#:: I've issued a clarifying statement in the discussion area, to address the concern of the opposer. [[Special:Contributions/76.66.193.119|76.66.193.119]] ([[User talk:76.66.193.119|talk]]) 06:45, 25 July 2010 (UTC)
# Both Canadians and Mexicans resent the Americans' self-assigned hegemony over them and prefer not to be grouped together with the US. The racist treatment my Mexican friends receive in the US infuriates me. Canadians have way more in common with Mexicans politically these days than they do with the Americans who are totally bananas most of the time. Really, really bad idea. [[User:Varlaam|Varlaam]] ([[User talk:Varlaam|talk]]) 17:24, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
#: I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean. We have [[WP:WikiProject South America]], [[WP:WikiProject Europe]], [[WP:WikiProject Africa]]. This is a continent based wikiproject, not a request for a union of everyone in North America.

===Discussion===
This project is not intended to cover the minutiae of the area known as North America, rather it is supposed to be a supranational coordination project to deal with supranational issues, transborder issues, issues dealing with historical topics that predate the establishment of the governmental entities that are North America (Canada, Mexico, USA, Greenland, principally). It would complement the WikiProjects such as [[WP:WikiProject Europe]], [[WP:WikiProject South America]], [[WP:WikiProject Antarctica]], [[WP:WikiProject Caribbean]], etc. As [[WP:WikiProject United States]] doesn't even cover most American articles, this WikiProject is not intended to cover those topics either. It would cover top-level articles, such as the countries themselves, the gross geographic/environmental areas, multinational areas, much as Matthewedwards mentions.
