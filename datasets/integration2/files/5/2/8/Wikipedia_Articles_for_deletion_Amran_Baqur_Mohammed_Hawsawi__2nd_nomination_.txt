Previously redirected after [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Amran Baqur Mohammed Hawsawi]], which didn't really focus on the article but just on the duplication of contents. However, there are no independent sources for this article (the two sources given don't mention Hawsawi at all!). So it fails [[WP:BIO]] and [[WP:BLP]]. Looking for other sources, I found nothing through Google Books[http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22Mohammed+Hawsawi%22+-wikipedia+-wiki&num=10][http://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22Mohammed+Hawsawi%22+-wikipedia+-wiki&num=10#sclient=psy&hl=en&tbs=bks:1&source=hp&q=%22Mohammad+Hawsawi%22+-wikipedia+-wiki&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&fp=f44be6d83191e66] or Google News Archives[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_scoring=r&as_maxm=2&q=%22Mohammad+Hawsawi%22+-wikipedia+-wiki&as_qdr=a&as_drrb=q&as_mind=9&as_minm=1&as_maxd=8&sa=N&tbs=nws:1,ar:1][http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_scoring=r&as_maxm=2&q=%22Mohammed+Hawsawi%22+-wikipedia+-wiki&as_qdr=a&as_drrb=q&as_mind=9&as_minm=1&as_maxd=8&sa=N&tbs=nws:1,ar:1].

*'''Delete'''.

*'''Keep''', even in English there are news articles; you just need to know that Amran = Umran and try variants of Muhammad/Mohamed. Sheesh, people don't even ''try''. [[User:Papermoneyisjustpaper|Papermoneyisjustpaper]] ([[User talk:Papermoneyisjustpaper|talk]]) 03:23, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
:'''Comment''' No offence but looking at your editing history i ask myself if you are a [[Wikipedia:Sock puppetry|sockpuppet]]. I suggest your !vote should be discounted unless you provide us with the necessary references that could establish notability. [[User:Iqinn|IQinn]] ([[User talk:Iqinn|talk]]) 03:49, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
**You claim that there are sources, but you don't provide any. Just give us a few specific indepth reliable independent sources to cinvince us, and people may well take your "keep" into account and change their opinion accordingly. But a claim without anything to back it up is meaningless here, and AfD is not a votecount but a policy- and source-based discussion.

*'''Delete''' - Fails notability.  The article is based on primary, governmental sources.  Subject has not been covered by news organizations and/or secondary sources.--[[User:Yachtsman1|Yachtsman1]] ([[User talk:Yachtsman1|talk]]) 20:07, 10 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - subject lacks "significant independent coverage" in [[WP:RS|reliable sources]] under the [[WP:GNG|general notability guideline]]. Bulk of the references are primary documents per [[WP:PRIMARY]]. [[User:Anotherclown|Anotherclown]] ([[User talk:Anotherclown|talk]]) 09:19, 11 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - as per everyone above - minus Papermoneyisjustpaper who has no compelling argument and is most likely a sock-puppet. [[User:Iqinn|IQinn]] ([[User talk:Iqinn|talk]]) 10:35, 13 February 2011 (UTC)
