'''Lesbian sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[women who have sex with women]], regardless of their [[sexual orientation]]. A woman who has sex with another woman may identify as a [[lesbian]] if she is sexually attracted to women, or [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] if she is not exclusively sexually attracted to women, or dispense with [[sexual identification]] altogether. The term may also be applied to a [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or [[asexuality|asexual]] woman who is unsure of or is exploring her sexuality.

[[Romance (love)|Romantic]] or sexual [[interpersonal relationship]]s are often subject to [[sexual desire]] and [[sexual arousal|arousal]], which then leads to sexual activity for sexual release. A physical expression of intimacy between women depends on the context of the relationship along with social, cultural and other influences.<ref name="Hite reports">{{cite web|title=The Hite Reports: What do they say?|publisher=hite-research.com|accessdate=November 19, 2011|url=http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm|archive-date=June 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601230726/http://www.hite-research.com/thehitereports.htm}}</ref>

==Behaviors==
===General===
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation.png|thumb|A woman [[nipple stimulation|orally stimulating the nipples]] of her sexual partner]]
Commonly, women engage in displays of affection, such as kissing on the cheek or hugging. A kiss on the lips, a prolonged kiss or hug, or other forms of touching, may or may not be regarded as [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. [[Sex educator]] and [[feminist]] [[Shere Hite]] stated that one of her female research subjects had written, "Sex with a woman includes: touching, kissing, smiling, looking serious, embracing, talking, digital intercourse, caressing, looking, cunnilingus, undressing, remembering later, making sounds, sometimes gently biting, sometimes crying, and breathing and sighing together."<ref name="Hite/lesbianism">{{cite web|title=Lesbianism: Women's Sexual Expression Together|publisher=hite-research.com|accessdate=February 3, 2012|url=http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html|archive-date=October 17, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017143602/http://www.hite-research.com/artlesbianism.html}}</ref>

Disrobing before a partner, removing the clothing of a partner or performing acts of [[physical intimacy]], such as the touching of a partner's [[erogenous zone]]s by the use of hands, tongue or rest of the mouth, may be regarded as indicators of the partner's desire for sexual activity and an [[erotic stimulus]] or turn-on (sexual arousal), which may generate erotic sensations in both partners. Allowing such acts of physical intimacy, especially the stimulation of a partner's breasts and nipples, is an indication of  reciprocal interest in sexual activity.

A woman's mouth, lips and tongue may be sensitive erogenous zones; they are commonly used by partners during the preliminary stages and throughout a sexual activity, whether for kissing, sucking, licking or specifically for [[oral sex]]. The stimulation of a partner's breasts, including [[nipple stimulation|oral or manual stimulation of the nipples]], is a form of [[foreplay]]. Breast and nipple stimulation of women is a common aspect of sexual activity.<ref name=levin>Levin, Roy J. " The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality". ''Sexual & Relationship Therapy''.

===Dominance, submission and BDSM===
On occasion, for variety, or on a more regular or routine basis, a woman may assume a passive role during sexual activity and leave it to her partner to provide their sexual satisfaction, which can also be an aspect of [[dominance and submission]]. For example, a person in a doggy style position may be passive and open to a variety of sex acts, generally at the choice of the active partner, such as fingering from behind, massage or stimulation of erogenous zones, including the genitals, nipples, or buttocks, and receiving a [[erotic spanking|playful spank]] to the buttocks.<ref name= Rogiere>Rogiere, Jean, "The Little Book of Sex". Ulysses Press. 2001. {{ISBN|1-56975-305-9}}, 96 pages.</ref> The active partner can also introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]], into the vagina or anus.

To ensure passivity and to enhance the feeling of or actual [[female submission]], a partner may also take part in [[sexual bondage|bondage]] (such as handcuffs) or in other [[BDSM]] activities.<ref name=Carroll2/><ref name="Kimmel"/> During sexual bondage, the restrained partner is generally open to a variety of sex acts and cannot interfere in the ensuing sexual activity. She is dependent for her sexual satisfaction on the actions of her partner, who can choose the type and pace of the sexual activity and can introduce sex toys. For example, a [[pecker gag]] can be used to [[gag (BDSM)|gag]] the restrained partner as well as to require her to suck during sexual activity in a similar manner to an [[adult pacifier]]. The active partner has the role of treating the restrained partner as a [[sex object]] to be used for her own sexual satisfaction. The active partner may herself derive sexual satisfaction from providing her sex partner with sexual satisfaction and bringing her to orgasm.

==Research and views==
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|Late 19th-century painting by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]] showing the use of a strap-on dildo]]
In 1953, [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s ''[[Kinsey Reports|Sexual Behavior in the Human Female]]'' documented that, over the previous five years of sexual activity, 78% of women had orgasms in 60% to 100% of sexual encounters with other women, compared with 55% for heterosexual sex.<ref>[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, A.]]; [[Wardell Pomeroy|Pomeroy, W.]]; [[Clyde Martin|Martin, C.]], & [[Paul Gebhard|Gebhard, P.]] ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Female'', Philadelphia: Saunders (1953), {{ISBN|978-0-253-33411-4}}.</ref> Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women's sexuality and how to optimize women's sexual satisfaction than male partners do.<ref name="Weiten">{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =978-1-111-18663-0|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|page=386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&pg=PT423|author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S.

Studies by [[Pepper Schwartz]] and Philip Blumstein (1983) and Diane Holmberg and Karen L. Blair (2009) contradict research indicating that women in same-sex relationships are more sexually satisfied than their heterosexual counterparts. Schwartz concluded that lesbian couples in committed relationships have less sex than any other type of couple, and that they generally experience less sexual intimacy the longer the relationship lasts, though this study has been subject to debate (see [[Lesbian bed death]]).<ref name="Greenberg"/><ref name="Iasenza"/><ref name="McCroy">{{cite news|first=Winnie|last=McCroy|title=The Myth of Lesbian Bed Death|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-06-22/news/myth-of-lesbian-bed-death/}}</ref><ref name="Dowling">{{cite web|first=Nikki|last=Dowling|title=Girl On Girl: Lesbian Bed Death Is A Big, Fat Myth|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=February 20, 2011|publisher=[[The Frisky (website)|The Frisky]]|url=http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-girl-on-girl-i-think-lesbian-bed-death-is-a-big-fat-myth/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008201545/http://www.thefrisky.com/post/246-girl-on-girl-i-think-lesbian-bed-death-is-a-big-fat-myth/|archive-date=October 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Holmberg and Blair's study, on the other hand, published in ''[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]]'', found that women in same-sex relationships enjoyed identical sexual desire, sexual communication, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with orgasm as their heterosexual counterparts.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sexual Desire, Communication, Satisfaction, and Preferences of Men and Women in Same-Sex Versus Mixed-Sex Relationships |first1=Diane |last1=Holmberg |first2=Karen Lyndsay |last2=Blair |pages=57–66 |doi=10.1080/00224490802645294 |issn=1559-8519 |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research|The Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=46 |issue=1 |year=2009 |url=http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20&%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021062010/http://www.klbresearch.com/KLB_Research/Research_files/Holmberg%20%26%20Blair%20JSR%20Vol%2046%20Iss%201%202009.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-21 |citeseerx=10.1.1.533.9867 |pmid=19116863 |s2cid=26863933 }}</ref> Additional research by Blair & Pukall (2014) reported similar findings, such that women in same-sex relationships reported similar levels of overall sexual satisfaction and lower levels of sexual frequency.

With regard to the ease or difficulty of achieving orgasm, Hite's research (while subject to methodological limitations) showed that most women need clitoral (exterior) stimulation for orgasm, which can be "easy and strong, given the right stimulation" and that the need for clitoral stimulation in addition to knowing one's own body is the reason that most women reach orgasm more easily by masturbation.<ref name="Hite reports"/><ref name="The Hite Report">{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|author-link=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2004|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=978-1-58322-569-1|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&lpg=PP1}}</ref> Replicating Kinsey's findings, studies by scholars such as Peplau, Fingerhut and Beals (2004) and Diamond (2006) indicate that lesbians have orgasms more often and more easily in sexual interactions than heterosexual women do.<ref name="Weiten"/>

Preferences for specific sexual practices among female same-sex relationships have also been studied. Masters and Johnson concluded that vaginal penetration with dildos is rare and lesbians tend to do more overall genital stimulation than direct clitoral stimulation, which is also often the case for heterosexual relationships.<ref name="Greenberg"/> Concerning oral sex, the common belief that all women who have sex with women engage in cunnilingus contrasts research on the subject.

In 2003, Julia V Bailey and her research team published data based on a sample from the [[United Kingdom]] of 803 lesbian and bisexual women attending two London lesbian sexual health clinics and 415 women who have sex with women (WSW) from a community sample; the study reported that the most commonly cited sexual practices between women "were oral sex, digital vaginal penetration, mutual masturbation, and tribadism (frottage with genital-to-genital contact or rubbing of the genitals against another part of the partner's body), each of which occurred in 85% of [women who have sex with women]". Like older studies, the data also showed that vaginal penetration with dildos, or with other sex toys, among women who have sex with women is rare.<ref name="Zenilman & Shahmanesh"/><ref name="Bailey">{{cite journal|title=Sexual behaviour of lesbians and bisexual women|author1=J V Bailey |author2=C Farquhar |author3=C Owen |author4=D Whittaker |journal=[[Sexually Transmitted Infections (journal)|Sexually Transmitted Infections]]|volume=79|issue=2|date=April 2003|pmid=12690139|doi=10.1136/sti.79.2.147|pages=147–150|pmc=1744617}}</ref> A 2012 online survey of 3,116 women who have sex with women, published in ''[[The BMJ]]'', found the majority of women reporting a history of genital rubbing (99.8%), vaginal fingering (99.2%), genital scissoring (90.8%), cunnilingus (98.8%) and vibrator use (74.1%).<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=22563015 | doi=10.1136/sextrans-2011-050404 | volume=88 | issue=6 | title=Sexual behaviour and risk reduction strategies among a multinational sample of women who have sex with women | year=2012 | journal=Sex Transm Infect | pages=407–12 | last1 = Schick | first1 = V | last2 = Rosenberger | first2 = JG | last3 = Herbenick | first3 = D | last4 = Reece | first4 = M| s2cid=40414979 }}</ref>

==Health risks==
Like most sexual activity, lesbian sexual activities can carry risks of [[sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs), such as [[Herpes genitalis|genital herpes]] or other [[pathogen]]ic infections. When lesbian sexual activity is of a non-penetrative nature, the risk of exchange of [[bodily fluid]]s is generally lower and therefore the incidence of transmission of sexually transmitted infections is also relatively low,<ref name="Hales">{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn =978-0495391920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&pg=PA269}}</ref><ref name="Alexander">{{cite book|author1=William Alexander|author2= Helaine Bader|author3= Judith H.

The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) did not recognize female-to-female transmission as a possible method of HIV infection until 1995. The CDC reported there is little data available regarding the risk of spreading sexually transmitted infections between women.<ref name="CDC"/> However, the CDC states that pathogens such as metronidazole-resistant [[trichomoniasis]], genotype-concordant HIV, [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV, which has been linked to nearly all cases of [[cervical cancer]]) and [[syphilis]] can be spread through sexual contact between women.<ref name="CDC"/> While the rates of these pathologies are unknown, one study showed 30% of lesbians and bisexual women had medical histories with sexually transmitted infections.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lee R |title=Health care problems of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender patients |journal=West.

Health Canada noted "the prevalence of all types of HPV (cancer and non-cancer-causing) in different groups of Canadian women ranges from 20%–33%" and an American university study found 60% of sexually active females were infected with HPV at some time within a three-year period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Genuis|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Genuis|first2=Shelagh K.|title=Managing the sexually transmitted disease pandemic: A time for reevaluation|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=191|issue=4|pages=1103–1112|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2004.03.019|year=2004|pmid=15507928}}</ref>

The ''[[American Family Physician]]'' suggests that lesbian and bisexual women "cover sex toys that penetrate more than one person's vagina or anus with a new condom for each person" and to "consider using different toys for each person", to use a [[Barrier contraception|protection barrier]] (for example, a latex sheet, [[dental dam]], cut-open condom or plastic wrap) during oral sex and to "use latex or vinyl gloves and lubricant for any manual sex that might cause bleeding unprotected contact with a sexual partner's menstrual blood and with any visible genital lesions".<ref name="Mravack"/> However, there "is no good evidence" that using a dental dam reduces STI transmission risks between women who have sex with women; studies show that using a dental dam as a protection barrier is rarely practiced, and that, among women who have sex with women, this may be because the individuals have "limited knowledge about the possibilities of STI transmission or [feel] less vulnerable to STIs [such as HIV]".<ref name=" Zenilman & Shahmanesh"/>
