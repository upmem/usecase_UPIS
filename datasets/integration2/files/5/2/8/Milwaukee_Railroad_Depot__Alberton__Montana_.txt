The '''Milwaukee Railroad Depot''' in [[Alberton, Montana]] was built by the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad]] (a.k.a. Milwaukee Road) in 1908, during its Pacific Extension from [[Chicago, Illinois]] to [[Tacoma, Washington]] from 1906-09. The depot is a rectangular one-story wood frame building constructed in the Craftsman style.

When the Milwaukee Road built its transcontinental line, it placed a division point at Alberton. In addition to the depot, there were also a [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]], [[Turntable (railroad)|turntable]] and locomotive repair shops. The depot became the center of the commercial district of the town and the railroad was the town's major employer.<ref>Historic Research Associates, ''Historic Resources of Alberton, Montana'', National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Documentation Form, 1997.</ref>

When the railroad was [[railway electrification system|electrified]] in the 1920s, the roundhouse and turntable were removed.

When the railroad went bankrupt in the 1980s, the depot was sold to the Town of Alberton and is now used as a community center.<ref>James R. McDonald, ''Milwaukee Railroad Depot (Mineral County, Montana)'', National Register of Historic Places Registration Form, 1997.</ref>

The depot was listed in the National Register because of its architecture and association with The Milwaukee Road and the development of railroads in Montana.
