'''Claus O. Wilke''' is a [[Computational Biology|computational]] and [[Evolutionary Biology|evolutionary biologist]] and chair of the Department of Integrative Biology at [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he is the Dwight W. and Blanche Faye Reeder Centennial Fellow in Systematic and Evolutionary Biology, and currently holds the Joseph J. & Jeanne M. Lagowski Regents Professorship in Molecular Bioscience.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://integrativebio.utexas.edu/component/cobalt/item/7-integrative-biology/237-wilke-claus-o?Itemid=1224/ |title=Wilke profile at UT Austin | access-date= 2017-08-26 }}</ref> Wilke obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in 1999, and subsequently worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in the lab of [[Chris Adami]]. He moved to UT Austin as an assistant professor in 2006, where he is now professor, department chair, and director of the [[Wilke Lab]]. Wilke studies the evolution of molecules and viruses using theoretical and computational methods. He is also the author of the [[Cowplot]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/vignettes/introduction.html |title=Introduction to cowplot }}</ref> and [[ggridges]]<ref> {{cite web |url=https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html |title=Introduction to ggridges}}</ref> plotting packages.
