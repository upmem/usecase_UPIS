'''Pelkie''' is an [[unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. The community is on the [[Sturgeon River (Michigan)|Sturgeon River]] in the northeast part of [[Baraga Township, Michigan|Baraga Township]].<ref name="GR2">{{gnis|1621187}}</ref>

Pelkie was settled by [[French Canadians]] in about 1885, and was first known as "'''King's Landing'''" and was renamed Pelkie after an early settler, William Pelkie.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Woertman|first1=Elizabeth|title=Pelkie-King Family Sketch|date=1991|page=1|url=http://www.thelarrykinggen.com/getperson.php?personID=I1133&tree=1|accessdate=11 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Thurner |first=Arthur W. |title=Strangers and Sojourners: A History of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdm0X9c0XPcC |accessdate=2008-09-01 |year=1995 |publisher=Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn=0-8143-2396-0 |chapter=Ethnicity and Singularity |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdm0X9c0XPcC |quote=French Canadian woodsmen settled at a place in Baraga County in 1885 known as King's Land; but when farmers arrived to till the cutover land, the place became Pelkie, named after an early settler. |page=142 }}</ref> [[Finnish people|Finns]] who settled there initially called the place [[Kyrö]], after the place they came from in [[Finland]]; however, Kyro Location is now regarded as a distinct town from Pelkie.

The Historic Pelkie Grade School museum, constructed in 1909, is the only one-room schoolhouse still standing in Baraga County, and is listed on the State Register of Historic Sites on June 10, 1980. The building was used as a school until 1932, then as a town hall, and underwent restoration beginning in 1979. The museum also houses a horse-drawn school bus.

Today, Pelkie is home to the Baraga County Fair, which is held every year on the second weekend in August. The community's primary economic activity is dairy farming, and most of the milk is shipped to processors in Wisconsin.
