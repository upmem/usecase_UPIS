The '''''Statue of Ebih-Il''''' is a 25th-century BC statue of the praying figure of Ebih-Il ({{cuneiform|𒂗𒋾𒅋}}, <small>EN-TI-IL</small>, ''e-bih-il''),<ref name="SD"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=THUREAU-DANGIN |first1=F. |title=Inscriptions Votives Sur des Statuettes de Maʾeri |journal=Revue d'Assyriologie et d'archéologie orientale |date=1934 |volume=31 |issue=3 |page=143 |jstor=23297288 |issn=0373-6032}}</ref> superintendent of the ancient city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] in modern eastern [[Syria]]. The statue was discovered at the Temple of [[Ishtar]] in Mari during excavations directed by [[French people|French]] archaeologist [[André Parrot]]. It is made of [[gypsum]], with inlays of [[schist]], [[Seashell|shells]] and [[lapis lazuli]]. Claire Iselin of the [[Musée du Louvre]], where the statue is displayed, describes it as "a masterpiece by virtue of its craftsmanship, state of preservation, and expressive style."<ref name="louvre">{{cite web|url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/ebih-il-superintendent-mari|title=Ebih-Il, the Superintendent of Mari|first1=Claire|last1=Iselin|publisher=[[Musée du Louvre]]|accessdate=10 October 2012}}</ref>

==Overview==
The statue, made of translucent smooth [[alabaster]], depicts the figure of a man seated on a [[wicker]] [[Tuffet|hassock]]. The man is shown in a praying posture with hands clasped against his chest conveying his devotion to the deity.<ref name="louvre"/>

The man's head is shaved. His long beard is composed of vertical curls and has holes drilled, and was formerly inlaid with another, now-lost material.<ref name="louvre"/> The beard accentuates the figure's cheeks and finely sculpted lips that convey a half-smile. The figure's staring blue eyes were crafted with particular care and attention to detail. A combination of [[schist]], [[Seashell|shells]] and [[lapis lazuli]] was used to depict the [[eyelash]]es and [[eyelid]]s, [[cornea]] and [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]], respectively.<ref name=Parrot26>Parrot, 1935, p. 26.</ref> The lapis lazuli inlays used were imported from as far east as [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="louvre"/>

The figure has a bare torso and a thin waist. The hands are clasped against the chest, and the left hand is closed and placed inside the right hand.<ref name=Parrot26/> The figure's only dress is the [[History of Sumer|Sumerian]]-style ceremonial [[kaunakes]] skirt. The elaborate fleece skirt appears to be made from [[Hide (skin)|animal hide]] (probably, [[sheepskin]] or [[Goatskin (material)|goatskin]]) as evidenced by the presence of a tail at the back.<ref name="louvre"/> The figure's feet are missing but their attachment piece is still showing under the dress.<ref name=Parrot26/>

The inscription in [[proto-cuneiform]] signs on the rear, which identifies the work, reads: "Statue of Ebih-Il, the superintendent, dedicated to [[Ishtar]] Virile."<ref name="louvre"/>

==Excavation==
The statue was discovered in two parts by the French excavation team under [[André Parrot]].<ref name=Ebih>Cluzan; Lecompte, 2011, p. 5.</ref> The head was found on the pavement of the outer court of the Temple of Ishtar.<ref name=Parrot26/> The body, along with the smaller statue of King [[Lamgi-Mari]], was found a few meters away.<ref name=Ebih/> When the statue was found, the left arm and elbow were broken, and the base of the right elbow was shattered.<ref name=Parrot26/> The statues were the first major discovery in the excavations, started in winter 1933, at the site of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]].<ref>Parrot, 1935, p. 1.</ref> The statue of Ebih-Il was discovered on 22 January 1934 (for the head), and 23 January 1934 (for the body).<ref>{{cite web |title=Voués à Ishtar.
