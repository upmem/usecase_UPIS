==Course description==
The last decade has been marked by significant transformations in the way communication is forged by institutions and individuals. This course will focus on the theoretical premises of such trends and movements, the fashion by which they utilize media trends, their patterns and content. Readings and class discussions will examine the categorical definitions of radical, independent, alternative, social, network and user-produced media and their contextualization within local, global and hybrid locales. From the use of video-sharing portals for self-memorialization and historicization to major public events (e.g Twitter during and after the 2009 Iranian Presidential elections) to the utilization of microblogging both as commodification and subversion to authority, the course will explore how new media technology can be perceived/appropriated as simultaneously hegemonic and counterhegemonic.
