Does not meet [[WP:Verify]] and [[WP:NOTE]], Nothing apart from a Facebook page. Nothing reliable in Google [[User:Wikishagnik|Wikishagnik]] ([[User talk:Wikishagnik|talk]]) 05:17, 9 October 2012 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - I haven't found any relevant third-party sources with Google US or España and that Facebook page hardly mentions anything. I'm concerned because it appears the awards were cancelled in 2010 and mtvla.com results [http://www.mtvla.com/buscar/?query=Los%20Premios suggest] this is so. This may be a hoax.
