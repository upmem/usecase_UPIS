== Ukrainian photos from WWII ==

I have a question about some photos taking in the modern-day Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union) during World War II. They were taken by Soviet military photographers, and I'm not sure when they were first published. The place that I would scan them from is a book, ''Hitler versus Stalin: The Second World War on the Eastern Front in Photographs'' by John and Ljubica Erickson, published in 2001. It credits the images to the "Rodina Archive in Moscow and the Leonid Pitersky Collection in St. Petersburg." With that information, can someone help me pick out an appropriate tag to upload them? I haven't uploaded any of them yet; I don't want them to get deleted while searching for the right tag. Any help would be appreciated, and while I'll gladly try to help if I need to provide more information, I'm not sure if I can. &ndash; [[User:Joe_N|<font color="green">Joe&nbsp;Nu</font>]][[User talk:Joe_N|<font color="red">tter</font>]] 20:32, 28 December 2008 (UTC)
:If {{tl|PD-Russia-2008}} doesn't apply (which you'll need to determine for each individual image), then you would need to use a [[WP:ICT/FU|non-free tag]], like {{tlp|non-free fair use in|Article name}} and an appropriate [[WP:NFURG|rationale]].

::I don't think it would apply - it was taken in 1944, and the license mentions if they died before 1942. I also don't think I could apply anything fair use to it, because they're mostly pictures of tanks driving across the countryside, wrecked trucks, and guns going off. They aren't non-replaceable, I just would like them while I'm trying to get the article on the battle they were taken in up the assessment ladder with only maps and no pictures. &ndash; [[User:Joe_N|<font color="green">Joe&nbsp;Nu</font>]][[User talk:Joe_N|<font color="red">tter</font>]] 17:06, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

== Basic image upload question ==

Hi,
Perhaps a basic question, but I´d appreciate some help.
I recently uploaded the image [[:File:Andreas Öberg.jpg]] but haven't been able to provide information to prevent deletion in 7 days (see template). What should I do? Or on which page/URL do I find help?
(I have tried to locate this info but I am not so sure I am on the right track...)
Thank you, [[User:Dafos|Dafos]] ([[User talk:Dafos|talk]]) 13:04, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
:Clearly [http://www.flickr.com/photos/graguitar/1011629777/sizes/o/ the Flickr image] is copyright according to that page.

:The uploader's username is basically the same as JV Benjamin, so I think it's safe to assume that the uploader is the copyright holder.

== US National Archives photo ==

The last image of the website [http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/22/22053.htm], I had see that it was [[US National Archives]] photo. Is it in public domain or GNU free license?

:I'm not 100% sure, but it seems very likely to be a work of the US Navy.  It is identified as a National Archives photo taken by Robert Hurst.  Most of the other Robert Hurst photographs claim more clearly that such works were official photos taken by the Navy.  It's difficult to say with absolute conviction, but I would believe the photo to be a work of the federal gov't and therefore appropriately tagged by <nowiki>{{PD-USGov}}</nowiki>.  -[[User:Seidenstud|Seidenstud]] ([[User talk:Seidenstud|talk]]) 09:26, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

== Cover to a discontinued bootleg of a demo tape ==

Hey, 

I recently uploaded the file [[:File:Bowel of Chiley.jpg]] and I don'tknow which is the licence.

It is a demo tape by band [[Mr. Bungle]] and it was released without any permission on bootleg by Playhouse Productions, on 1991.

The original is very hard to find. Which licence applies?  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Alvareo|Alvareo]] ([[User talk:Alvareo|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Alvareo|contribs]]) 13:11, 1 January 2009 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned --> <!--Autosigned by SineBot-->

::The fact it is a cover of a musical release would seem, at first glance, to allow it to be used under the criteria found at the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|policy on Fair Use]]. However there are several issues at play. First, in general, articles on demos and/or bootlegs are not allowed per the [[WP:NALBUMS|"Albums, singles and songs"]] guidelines for notability. If this demo/bootleg can not meet the [[WP:GNG|General notability guideline]] and the subject specific notability guideline than no article would exist about the recording and that would disallow a fair use claim. 
::If you can not use a claim of fair use the second (and third) issue would be if the image featured on the cover was a free image or not and, if so, who did the layout and design of the cover. In other words you currently state the image is taken from a website and that the "author" is "Unknown" so that would automatically raise a red flag as a possible copyvio ''unless'' it was established that it was [[Public domain]]. Because the website that you took this from gives no indication of the copyright status it is doubtful, from looking at the site, there would be any legit claim of ownership to this, or any of the images on the site, if they were to "give permission" for it's use. And even if the image featured on the cover were established as "free" it would not mean the layout of the cover would also be free. This image aside for a moment, there are numerous "royalty free" and "stock images" that can be used in layout and design work, however the resulting [[Derivative work#When does derivative-work copyright exist?|derivative work may not be free]]. And as for finding images on the internet [[Public domain#Freely obtained does not mean free to republish|freely obtained does not mean free to republish]]. [[User:Soundvisions1|Soundvisions1]] ([[User talk:Soundvisions1|talk]]) 21:42, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

:Even though the distribution of the music itself may have been a copyright violation, someone (presumably Playhouse Productions) still owns the copyright to the album cover, which is all we're concerned about in this case.  I would say treat it as any other album cover.  Use '''<nowiki>{{Non-free album cover}}</nowiki>'''.   As usual, it would need a fair use rationale, and '''<nowiki>{{Album cover fur}}</nowiki>''' should suffice.  That said, I noticed that "Bowel of Chiley" does not seem to have an article, and I question if it is [[WP:NN|notable]] enough on its own to have one.  So make sure that use of this image in another article is not decorative which would be a violation of [[WP:FUC]].

== Copyright Status of Mug Shots ==

What would the acceptability and copyright status of mug shots taken by local and state police departments and distributed to the public and press be? I'm spacifically talking about this one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jeffrey_Epstein_mug_shot.jpg? I recieved a message on my "Talk" page disputing the copyright, and thus having it at Wikipedia. But look, it *WAS* distributed free of charge to the press and anyone who asked the Palm Beach cops for it. [[User:Proxy User|Proxy User]] ([[User talk:Proxy User|talk]]) 20:39, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

:In general, distribution, not matter how widespread and '''[[gratis|free of charge]]''', does not make a piece of media '''[[Gratis versus Libre|free]]''' or in the public domain.  Also, while works by the US federal government are automatically in the [[public domain]], works of state and local governments are usually not (with a number of exceptions).  So, most non-federal mugshots, should be tagged with '''<nowiki>{{Non-free mugshot}}</nowiki>''' with an appropriate [[WP:FUG|fair use rationale]].   
:'''However''', Florida is one of the handful of states whose works (most of them, anyway) [[Copyright status of work by the Florida government|are automatically PD]].  So, this image can be tagged as PD.  However, being PD, it may as well be uploaded to [[Wikimedia Commons]], where there happens to be a template ('''<nowiki>{{PD-FLGov}}</nowiki>''') for Florida government works.  I'll go ahead and movie it to commons.  -[[User:Seidenstud|Seidenstud]] ([[User talk:Seidenstud|talk]]) 21:53, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

:Actually 61 years is not old enough for an unpublished photo in the US to be in the public domain. The copyright, unless it was assigned to you by the author of the photo, does not run out until 75 years after the death of the author. See: [[Wikipedia:Public domain#Current standard copyright duration in U.S. law]]. You claim the copyright was given to you. How? Being in the photo or having it in your possession does not give you the copyright to a photo, unless it was a "work for hire", in which case you would own the copyright and therefore have the right to release the image into the public domain yourself, or the copyright was specifically assigned to you. You need to show that you are actually the copyright holder and then you can put in into PD so that it can be used on Wikipedia. Hope that helps.

== License tagging for File:Integer Partition Table.png ==

I received the following message:

Thanks for uploading File:Integer Partition Table.png. You don't seem to have indicated the license status of the image. Wikipedia uses a set of image copyright tags to indicate this information; to add a tag to the image, select the appropriate tag from this list, click on this link, then click "Edit this page" and add the tag to the image's description. If there doesn't seem to be a suitable tag, the image is probably not appropriate for use on Wikipedia.

I'm having trouble understanding the Wikipedia software and I'm not a patent lawyer, so I probably don't fully understand the copyright language.  I suppose that my first question should be whether or not there is a user manual for understanding the terminology and how to use the Wikipedia software.  I keep trying to tag my files and they seem to be tagged correctly from my view, but they keep coming back as untagged or as an orphanbot.  Any help would be appreciated.  The file in question is a table that I generated.  The values and methods used to generate the table are supported by a new reference that I will include with the reupload of this file.  I provided a reference with the last upload, which I found on the internet, but the new reference will be better.--[[User:JNLII|JNLII]] ([[User talk:JNLII|talk]]) 16:55, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

:Please see [[WP:ICTIC]]. If you are the sole creator of the content, you need to decide how you want to distribute your content. After that, you need to simply add, for example, {{tl|PD-self}} (or what ever license you choose) to the image page. Also, when you upload the file, there is a drop down menus box titled "licensing" which allows you to choose your license (and if you choose a license from the drop down menu, it will automatically add the tag to your image when you upload it). Let me repeat that. On the upload page, you have the option to choose the license you want. You must have been leaving it blank every single time you uploaded it, or we have some strange glitch in our software ;) Finally, if you are uploading free images, please consider uploading them directly to [[:commons:Main page|Wikimedia Commons]] as all free images are eventually moved there anyway. If you have further questions, feel free to ask. I'd be glad to try and help you.-[[User:Andrew c|Andrew&nbsp;c]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Andrew c|<sup>[talk]</sup>]] 17:18, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for your help.  I tried it again.  I noticed that if I remember that I need to add something and then return to the upload page, my license selection goes back to none selected, so this may be my problem.  This time, I made certain to include in the textbox a line that says {{PD-self}} and I selected as a license "Own work released to public domain".  The file was originally uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, so I reloaded it in the same place.  I also added a short description for references, but the textbook citation will have to wait until I get home, where I have the book.--[[User:JNLII|JNLII]] ([[User talk:JNLII|talk]]) 18:58, 2 January 2009 (UTC)

== Colossal Cave Adventure Screenshot (Freeware, 1970s) ==

Some time ago I managed to track down a copy of the source code for Will Crowther's original Colossal Cave Adventure (the 1970s game that coined the magic words XYZZY and the infamous maze of twisty little passages).  After some other people compiled that source code and released the exe files, I fired up the exe file in a Windows cmd window, adjusted the font and color scheme for aesthetic purposes, and then uploaded a screenshot.  Yet the image has been tagged as non-free content and flagged for removal.  

It's a text-only freeware program, there is no box cover art, and a screenshot of the interface is vital to explaining how a command-line parser-driven text game works.  

I'm at a loss as to what to do... the software was freeware (so I don't see why it's been tagged as non-free), the screenshot is just text (and I'm not sure what to make of the request to reduce the file size -- if the text is still legible, then a reduced image wouldn't change the percentage of the program's content that's being reproduced, especially since I adjusted the typesize and color scheme on the Windows cmd utility myself, so it's not as if a larger image would reproduce more of the software's content).  I could adjust the command line window's settings so that the typesize is really big, take a screenshot at that resolution, and then reduce the image, but that would be... well, that would be stupid.  There is no box cover for this version, and even if there were, the box art would not actually show what the program interface is like.

I'm not experienced with Wikipedia templates, but I presume there is some way to keep the copyright-bots at bay, so if someone could add the appropriate templates, I'll be happy to fill out what I can.

Thank you for your time.

== Problems with deletions of converted image files ==

[[User talk:WillT.Net|WillT.Net]] created a bunch of images from gif or png formats to svg. At least some of the these were existing images on WP or Commons that had good fair use information, such as the gif that he replaced with http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:AHS_Eagles_Logo.svg He made claims that he had created some of these images himself, which were in some cases not true, but probably in good faith (meaning that he had converted them himself).  As he replaced the previous fair use images with his, the originals became orphaned and were deleted by bots.  Soon after I warned him [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:WillT.Net#Your_copyright_claims_for_converted_files] this would happen, after he put his image back on the [[American High School (Fremont, California)]] twice, and after several other editors had also givrn advice, he stopped posting. Now his converted images are being tagged for deletion.  This will result in several articles tha had valid fair use logo images no longer having one.  For American High School, the original gif is no longer available online and the Commons file is deleted.  If there is any way that the editors who work in this arena can clean this up without simply deleting all the images, I think that would be good.  If any deleted images with good fair use rationales can be revived or if their rationales can be added to the existing svg image files, perhaps they can be kept.--[[User:Hjal|Hjal]] ([[User talk:Hjal|talk]]) 07:35, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

:If you are talking about the image [[:File:Dennis.jpg]] which you then used in the [[Dennis O'Rear]] article, you have screwed up things. You uploaded the image with the same name as an existing image causing your image to overwrite the existing image and then be displayed in the other article. I have fixed that and removed your image from the [[Dennis O'Rear]] article for now. Just because someone gives you a photo of themselves does not mean they own the copyright but someone does, often the photographer. You need to find out if Dennis O'Rear owns the copyright or someone else and if he owns it, you need to get him to provide Wikipedia with a suitable licence we can use. He may even allow it to be in the public domain but that then means anyone can use it for any purpose.  Check out [[WP:BCI]] before you proceed to upload it again and make sure to use a '''unique name''' for the file as well as providing an acceptable licence. If you mean the [[:File:DJOREAR.jpg]] image you still need to find out who own the copyright per the above.

== Correct copyright tag for recently uploaded images ==

[[:File:Plateau_move_blank400b.jpg]]

I am the copyright holder of the game Plateau.  These images contain trademarked logos as well. I am fine with the images themselves being used/copied but I don't want to cloud the copyright/trademark of the game.

What copyright notice should I put with the images? [[User:Jwplwiki|Jwplwiki]] ([[User talk:Jwplwiki|talk]]) 00:11, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

:If this is a photograph of a board game (which it appears to be) and you are the photographer, you can choose to license the image however you want. Any of the free licenses (GFPL, CC-SA, etc) should be ok. Then you can also tag the image with [[Template:Trademark]] to make it clear regarding the logos and other material depicted within the free photograph.

== Use of official seal of state and local governments in the US ==

As yet there seems to be no consitent treatment of how seals of state and local governments in the US are treated.  What is the rule?  I am specifically concerned with the use of the official seal of the City of Manhattan Beach, California, which is used at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Beach,_California -- I checked and learned that the seal as shown was changed and adopted in 1961.  Can it be used here under the fair use doctrine?  If so, how should the fair use rationale be completed?  Thanks  [[User:Oconnell usa|Oconnell usa]] ([[User talk:Oconnell usa|talk]]) 19:39, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
:Unfortunately (for us), there can be no single, consistent rule for the treatment of state and local seals. The reason why is because their copyright status is judged on a case-by-case basis: for some states and locales, works created by government employees are in the public domain by default. However, in most areas copyright applies to government seals just it does for any other creative work. I don't know the status of works produced by the City of Manhattan Beach, CA, so you'd have to check. Alternatively, if it's a non-free image and you want to use it in a manner that is consistent with the [[WP:NFCC|non-free content criteria]] then see [[WP:FURG]] for information about how to create the appropriate non-free usage rationale. -- [[User:Hux|Hux]] ([[User talk:Hux|talk]]) 21:19, 29 December 2008 (UTC)
:: Be aware that copyright is not the only issue relating to state seals. The [[Oregon State Seal]], for instance, was produced in the 1850s, and is not eligible for copyright protection in the U.S.; however, there is a separate law governing its use. The seal may not be used (paraphrasing from memory, here) in any way that falsely implies official state endorsement of something. See the linked article for more detail.
:: In my personal, NON-LEGAL opinion, it's unlikely that any use on Wikipedia (illustrating the article on the state, for example) would violate this law; but YMMV. -[[User:Peteforsyth|Pete]] ([[User talk:Peteforsyth|talk]]) 00:22, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

While it may be permissable under fair use, it puts our institution needlessly at risk ... and makes our logo available for free use through Creative Commons, which is not the University's intent.

:[[:File:Brightside logo.gif]] was deleted because it didn't have proper licensing info, and [[:File:Brightside Group Logo.jpg]] was deleted because it was not being used. All images that are not free (such as a copyrighted log) must have an accompanying license tag (such as {{tl|Non-free logo}}) and a [[WP:RAT]], a fair use rational. You must explain why the image is used and how it qualifies for fair use (and we have helpful templates that you can fill out such as [[Template:Non-free use rationale]]. Finally, the image has to be used in the main article namespace, and nowhere else. Right now there is not [[Brightside Group]] article. You have a draft going in a user space [[User:Online Team/draft]], however since the user space is not the main article namespace, non-free images cannot be placed there. A bot removed the image from that draft for this reason (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Online_Team/draft&diff=255771739&oldid=255622425 here]). And that made the image unused. Unused, non-free images are basically automatically deleted after 7 days, so that is why the image was deleted. So, in summary, the image needs to be licensed, it needs a fair use rational, and it has to be used in an article in the main namespace (not the userspace or elsewhere).

:"Where this material is reproduced, published, broadcast or otherwise issued to others the source and copyright status must be acknowledged. For commercial applications there is a reproduction charge."  Does Wikipedia count as a commercial application?  Surely it's not making any money.  I would interpret that as saying there is no charge provided that we acknowledge the source and copyright status, which sounds pretty close to a Creative Commons attribution licence to me.  Of course, I'm no expert.  :-p  You could always contact them to ask for permission under such a licence, in any case.

== Image size ==

Hi. [[WP:ALBUM]] indicates that album covers should not be larger than 300px to meet [[WP:NFC]]. Is this based on a hard and firm rule, or just a rule of thumb? If an editor were, say, replacing smaller images with larger ([[:File:Lil'Kim-LaBellaMafia.jpg]] and [[:File:LaBellaMafiaclean.jpg]]) how would this be handled? Ordinarily, I'd tag it {{tl|nfr}}, but that's an odd tag to use when the image is already on wiki at a good size. Wanted to check and see if [[WP:ALBUM]] knows what it's talking about, particularly since I've already addressed one of this contributor's articles as [[WP:CSD#G4]], and I don't want to seem bitey.

I would advise choosing a license, uploading the images, placing the chosen license tag on the image pages (e.g. {{tl|cc-by-sa}}, see instructions at the top of the page if you need help), sending the permission email, and tagging the images {{tl|OTRS pending}} which indicates that permission has been sent.

I have been contributing to the article on the [[Scottsboro Boys]], which does not have pictures of them. This web site has a 1930s photo of them and their attorney as well as several Communist Party posters promoting their cause.
http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/a_f/boyle/chronology.htm I cannot find a copyright notice anywhere on that page in particular or that web site in general. Would it be permissible to upload and use that material?

::I spent some more time on that web site and see what you mean. However, that photo is on virtually every web site and shows up in every book about this case with no mention in any of the places that use it that it is being used with the permission of anyone else. That photo has to be in the public domain. By that rationale, would it be possible to say it was first published before 1978 without a copyright notice? 
::[[User:Springfieldohio|Springfieldohio]] ([[User talk:Springfieldohio|talk]]) 17:32, 8 January 2009 (UTC)
:::No, you can't just assume that, because you cannot easily find out who owns the copyright or who took the photo, that you can say "it was first published before 1978 without a copyright notice". I looked around the Library of Congress image files and while I did not find this photo, there are a few other Scottsboro Boys photos there and all are restricted use. The likely situation is that this was taken at the jail and so would be an official work of the state of Alabama. Most states official work is copyright to them not like federal official works that are PD in the US. I did see one newspaper that published the photo. Why not ask them what the source was? You have some work to do to find the answers. Otherwise your only chance is to use it as a non-free image with a fair-use rationale claim. [[User:Ww2censor|ww2censor]] ([[User talk:Ww2censor|talk]]) 22:25, 8 January 2009 (UTC)

:::Can you suggest such a fair use claim, so I can give it a shot. Again, that photo is everywere with no mention of having anyone's permission to use it. For instance, the Linder web site, while copyrighted, plainly says that he thinks his photos, including that one, are not copyrighted, but he does not know their source. "The materials included in the Famous Trials website are original works of authorship, government records, works for which copyright protection has expired, works reprinted with permission, or works that I believe are within the fair use protection of the copyright laws. If any author objects to the use of any work appearing in these pages, please contact me by e-mail and I will remove the work and review the propriety of including it. This is an educational and non-commercial site maintained at the University of Missouri-Kansas City Law School." http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/ftrials.htm The photo itself has no copyright notice or mention that anyone gave him permission to use it, so he must be relying on fair use to use it. If law Professor Linder thinks it is a fair use, one would think that there is a good case for it being a fair use.

:::[[User:Springfieldohio|Springfieldohio]] ([[User talk:Springfieldohio|talk]]) 12:58, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

::::Well, one way to find out is to upload it and see what happens. I uploaded that image with my best defense for a "fair use" rationale. It is posted in the Samuel Leibowitz article, where I gave it my best shot for a "fair use" justification. If it has to be removed, it has to be removed. However, that photo is so historically important, is so old and is so unlikely to be subject to a copyright (the web site from which it came frankly says that), I hope it will either be blessed as is or someone can add the right words to make it eligible for "fair use".

:::::The [[burden of proof]] is up to the uploader to supply the justification based on facts not conjecture. You are trying too hard to infer this image is in the public domain without any proof. Using words like: "that photo is so historically important, is so old and is so unlikely to be subject to a copyright" is cojecture and not proof. Using a fair use rationale may be acceptable but the text fair use rational that you added to the image file is not good enough these days, you need to put the {{tl|fair use rationale}} template into the file and fill it it completely. However, the use of the image [[:File:Leibowitz, Samuel & Scottsboro Boys 1932.jpg]] in [[:Samuel Leibowitz]] is definitely not acceptable until the rationale is fully completed.

== [[Paul von Hintze]] ==

So, the image [[:File:hintze.jpg]] has been tagged for deletion, on the grounds that there's no information about its source.  It is true, there's no information about its source.  That being said, the image is about 99% likely to be in the public domain.  Hintze is depicted in his uniform, and he retired from the Navy in 1911.  It is very doubtful he would have worn his uniform for a portrait after the end of the German Empire in 1918, which would put this image solidly in the public domain.  In addition, Hintze was 59 in 1923, when copyrights expire - he pretty clearly does not look to be over 60 in the image.  Beyond that, even if, by some chance, the image was taken after 1923, the chances are still pretty damned high that it's in the public domain.  Works published between 1923 and 1964 (and Hintze died in 1941) are only considered under copyright if a) a copyright notice was attached when originally published; and b) if the copyright was renewed in the 28th year after publication.  The idea that what is presumably a German portrait from the 1920s (at latest) would have had its U.S. copyright renewed is close to unbelievable.  So, while I can't ''prove'' that this image is in the public domain, it's incredibly likely that it is.  Surely whatever applies to allow [[:File:Daladier.jpg]] to be on the commons ought to apply to this image. [[User:John Kenney|john k]] ([[User talk:John Kenney|talk]]) 17:29, 10 January 2009 (UTC)
:I think you are missing the point. [[:File:hintze.jpg]] has no source indicated while [[:File:Daladier.jpg]] has its source indicated.

:::Okay, a few points.  Firstly, by "source" what are we talking about?  The Daladier image just notes that it comes from a French government website but has no further information about when it was taken.  I'm no longer sure where I got the image file from, but if I download a lower resolution version of the same image from [http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/graphics/hintze.jpg here] and say that's where I got it from, does that satisfy the "source" requirement?  Other than the fact that the French government is perhaps a more reliable source than firstworldwar.com, I don't see how the information on the origins of the Daladier image are any more detailed than providing that about Hintze.  I terms of TEB's comments about public domain, I will admit that I'm not an expert on copyright law, and stipulate that he's right.  That being said, the probability is still quite strong that the image was published before 1923.  But whatever.  The whole treatment of images on Wikipedia is absurd.  We have here an image which is most likely public domain, which, even if it is not public domain, is never going to actually be claimed as a copyright violation, and whose use would arguably be fair use even if it isn't public domain and is claimed as a copyright violation.  And yet we can't use it, apparently.  I'd add that, although I have no wish to see it deleted, because that would be ridiculous, by these standards, the Daladier image is pretty clearly on shaky ground as well.  The image page provides absolutely no evidence that the picture is more than 70 years old, or that its author never disclosed his identity.  Daladier was prime minister until 1940 and lived until 1970.  And we know absolutely nothing of the author - we have nothing but the uploader's word that it's anonymous.

:Obviously a copyright image of a major corporation.

== I was pointed here ==

so hopefully you can help. Copy-'n'-paste of my message from [[WT:CP]]:

I nominated the article [[Paul Grassi]] for deletion a few days ago, and while it looks like the article is probably going to be kept (if only as a redirect), there are three images on it that had uncertain copyright and source status. I told the uploader to specify their statuses, and he did on [[Talk:Paul Grassi]]. I have no idea if his specifications are sufficient, or if they are, what to put on the pages for the three images in question.

I am not sure why they have been tagged as such as I believe that all have a rationale - the page they were on has since been renamed (now [[Banknotes of Zimbabwe]] rather than Banknotes of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe).

:There is a much worse problem than the bot recognized: [[Banknotes of Zimbabwe]] has dozens of non-free images with no critical commentary. As it says in the {{tl|Non-free currency}} tag, the image may be used only “for the purposes of commentary or criticism relating to the image of the currency itself.” The use of these images is a major violation of Wikipedia’s [[WP:NFCC|non-free content policy]]. In particular, [[WP:NFCC#3]] says, “Multiple items of non-free content are not used if one item can convey equivalent significant information.” With critical commentary the article might be able to use one or two non-free images, but not dozens. And [[WP:NFCC#8]] says, “Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding.” The images are used only as illustrations; the text is perfectly understandable without the images. —[[User:TEB728|teb728]] [[User talk:TEB728|t]] [[Special:Contributions/TEB728|c]] 20:45, 9 January 2009 (UTC)

== Question about information I omitted by mistake and is now corrected ==

Dear Sirs:

I have uploaded [[:File:Yang_Zhen_Duo.jpg]] and obtained permission from the owner, Master Yang Jun, for the use of the picture under the GFDL.  I emailed this permission to permissions-commons@wikimedia.org.  Shortly after, I got a thank you note from permissions@wikimedia.org acknowledging the receipt of the documentation, and I noticed that the OTRS information is now in the picture's page.  I thought this was all I needed to do.

Unfortunately I did make the mistake of not including the name of Master Yang Jun as the copyright holder, who granted his permission to use the picture in its description.  So, several days later I got a warning that the picture might get deleted if I didn't comply with this.  I have  now corrected this.  <u>So am I now in compliance?</u>  Please tell me what else I need to do if I am not.

Please also clarify this: I thought that the documentation for this picture, which now exists in the OTRS, provides all the necessary information about the copyright owner and his permission for using the material.  <u>I don't understand why the picture is threatened with deletion (see [[User_talk:Panicpgh_#File source problem with File:Yang Zhen Duo.jpg|my talk]] page) when all the documentation already exists.</u>  Please consider this question '''<u>''aside''</u>''' from the fact that I didn't comply with the requirement of including the name of the copyright holder and the statement that he has granted permission for the use of the picture, a requirement that I have now fulfilled.

Thanks,

[[User:Panicpgh|Panicpgh]] ([[User talk:Panicpgh|talk]]) 21:31, 14 January 2009 (UTC)
:Everything looks good now.  The editor who put the OTRS authorization up is actually the same one who contacted you about the problem, so I'm not sure why he didn't just put in the missing information himself, but all is now well.

== Have permission from my Uncle to put up a picture he received in his will ==

I have a picture of "Merill Chase" for the article about him.  It was taken in 1977 by the Rockefeller Institute and passed on to my Uncle as part of the will.   He has no problem with 
it being on Wikipedia or whatever is necessary to put it up.  I am confused as to where to upload it.  I assume I forward an email from him to permissions-commons@wikimedia.org afterward? I want to upload a picture owned by someone else and have his permission.  This doesn't seem to be an option although it seems reasonable.

:If your uncle owns the *copyright* on the photograph (rather than just owning a copy of the photograph), then you can post it provided that your uncle is willing to release it under a free license (which would allow anybody to reuse the photograph for any purpose, basically subject only to the requirements of attribution).  If he isn't willing to do that, or if your uncle doesn't own the copyright to the photograph, then I'm afraid that you can't upload it.

Why are the rules for pictures stricter than the rules on content? The picture is more than 30 years old.  I doubt anyone at the Rockefeller University still works there who took the picture.  
Does that mean they hold the copyright?

== Sergio Galindo ==

I have a photo of the Mexican novelist Sergio Galindo that I want to upload to the Wikipedia article about him that I have authored. The photo appeared on the cover of the following publication:

Galindo, Sergio (1970). Nudo.  Mexico City: Editorial Joaquín Mortiz.

No copyright or authorship is indicated in the book, and the copyright for the book is now owned by the author's widow, Angela Gonzalez de Galindo, who also owns the original photograph.  The photograph was scanned and sent to me at her request by the author's son, Manuel Galindo. Sra Gonzalez de Galindo does not recall who took the photograph, which was taken over forty years ago.

I would appreciate advice. Thanks!

'''An image that you uploaded or altered, File:Diazphoto-2 .jpg, has been listed at Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images because its copyright status is unclear or disputed.

The copyright to the photo in question, is owned by the subject of the bio article - Ruben Diaz Jr.

The notice further encouraged me to pursue a "Non Free Content" license - but I'm not sure that is correct, since the owner of the photo (Diaz) never relinquished the copyright.  He is free to release the photo, at will.

The "Notice of Possible Photo Deletion" also stated that the photo had been "duplicated" from another source, which is incorrect. '''The photo itself''' was the original source.

What is the appopriate license or action to take, to avoid deletion (within 48 hours) of this and other photos?

:::Okay, first a couple things about the image description page. To credit images from the LOC, it's best to use the {{tl|LOC-image}} template. Also, be sure to check the rights information for each photo you get from the LOC. Some are PD and some aren't, for various reasons (they are by all means not always PD-USGov). So now the image description page is cleaned up. Next, for getting and downloading the high-res image files. At the LOC page, after clicking to the image page from the bibliographic info page, download the image from "Retrieve uncompressed archival TIFF version" - this gets you the good one. Then use some sort of photo editing software to change it from TIF (which wiki doesn't accept) to JPG. I also cropped it, corrected some perspective distortion, and fiddled with the levels a bit, but that's a bonus! Then from the wiki image page, select Upload a new version of this file. Then just select the image that is on your computer and upload over the top. I've actually done all this for you, but hopefully this will be useful for next time.

== Fair Use or my licence? ==

I'm thinking about taking a picture of a scale used in a hospital cafeteria, which has a state inspection seal on it, for use on the [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] article. There's no doubt that such an upload would be acceptable under Wikipedia's image policies (since the image would greatly aide in te indentification and recognition of the agency, since there's probably many people out there that would recognize those inspection seals even if they didn't recognize the agency itself by name), but the question is whether that would be a fair use upload or a licence of my choice upload. The seal itself, which is the whole purpose of the image's inclusion, I believe would be considered intellectual property of [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]], the Division of Standards exactly. Also, the scale is [[Hospital Corporation of America|HCA]] property (therefore not my own), but I doubt that's an issue. By the way, would it be acceptable to use such an image on articles other than [[Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services]] if it is fair use (for example, [[scale]])?

== Removing watermarks from images ==

I've gone through a number of images from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_with_watermarks Category:Images_with_watermarks] removing watermarks and I'm a little confused about all the various copyright licenses. "Public domain" I understand... no problem removing a watermark from those. But the others? Can someone familiar with the issue give me a simple plain english summary of which watermarks can/should be removed and which should stay? I'm happy to remove them here and there when I can, but I don't want to create problems. If the issue is complicated or full of gray areas, or depends on this or that, etc... I'll just stick to the public domain images and keep things simple for myself. Any guidance would be appreciated. [[User:Jbarta|JBarta]] ([[User talk:Jbarta|talk]]) 04:38, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
:This is a good question. The issue of "watermarking" and how to deal with it is an issue that is still very vague. I started a [[Wikipedia talk:Image use policy#Image use grey areas, confusion, and Photographer rights|discussion]] back in September 2008 that includes watermarking issues. As for your question there are images tagged that should not be. For example in looking at the first 4 images the first 3 contain watermarks that are small enough not to be a bother. They are also descriptive. [[:File:001-quiapochurch.jpg]]'s watermark blends in so well I would have missed it at a quick glance. [[:File:1153754022.jpg]] is a questionable image in the first place because it does not seem to be fully user created and it is sourced to a website, which is also watermarked on the image. Because of the website url it could be nominated under [[Wikipedia:CSD#G11|CSD G11]]. In the broader sense images such as [[:File:AVPmoviefilming.PNG]], [[:File:Alextrebek86.jpg]] and [[:File:CallTheShotsMusicVideo.jpg]] (and any image like it) are frame gabs being used under fair use. These should not have been tagged to begin with. To expand on that any image being that is tagged as Fair Use and is using a [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline|FUR]] should not be tagged with {{tl|watermark}}. Images such as [[:File:CheapTrickCollage4334-1000.jpg]] and [[:File:ChicagoCollage2-1000.jpg]] (along with the other collages the same user has created) are slightly more complicated. They seem like blatant advertising but removing the "advertising" portions - Chumash Casino Resort logo, website urls, show time/date - would be nearly impossible. However if one had the time to "cut up" the collages it could be done as they are all licensed under the [[http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/ Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.5]] license which allows for a "remix" of the image provided that credit is always given to "Dwight McCann/Chumash Casino Resort/www.DwightMcCann.com". The [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/legalcode full 2.5 CCL] has important wording in that should be considered. Namely section "4. Restrictions", subsection "c." which says, in part, that "You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work" as well as "in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit." (EDIT: I did some looking and found that the user stopped contributing his work because of credit removal. See the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BorgHunter&diff=prev&oldid=88756675 "Image Attribution" dif] on [[User talk:BorgHunter|BorgHunter]]'s talk page from November 19, 2006 that says, in part, "''Since having my images themselves "edited" by re-uploading the initial image while removing the attribution requirements and then having attributions removed from the articles themselves I have decided that the donation of my work in this manner does not suit my needs since all attribution quickly disappears.''" Also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Commander_Keane&diff=prev&oldid=86756668 "Attribution of Images" dif] on another user talk page from November 9, 2006 which partially says "''My intentions with regard to Wikipedia were to share high quality images of major artists for public use, but not without acknowledgment. This is clearly not an appropriate medium and my contributions were ill considered.''")

:Perhaps the best answer is to say to use your own judgment until the watermark "policy" is made more clear. If it is fair use I would say to remove the tag about watermarking and don't edit the image. If it is a freely licensed image but looks like a copyvio, and is unused or questionable if would meet our [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|Non-free content]] policy, I would say just make a nom for [[Wikipedia:CSD#I9|CSD i9]]. Beyond that just because an image has text on it, and someone may have tagged it, does not mean it needs to be "fixed". It is also best to read the full license to see what has to be done, if anything, when creating a derivative work - and yes, removing or croping something from an image makes it a derivative work.

::I was thinking about this, and I didn't bother replying because the OP asked for a ''simple english summary'' ;) My advice was going to be to basically ignore (or remove the tag) from non-free images. TV station identity on screenshots isn't really a watermark or otherwise problematic for that matter. But then I was thinking about something like [[:File:Dildostietc.jpg]]. It's a movie poster, and in the lower right corner, there is a third party web address indiafm.com. Since this third party site didn't create the movie or the poster, and has nothing really do to with the copyright or production of the poster, would it be OK to remove that? Same thing for [[:File:Msmt.jpg]] and the www.bollywoodhungama.com. What do others think about removing third party advertising from non-free images? If we do get the image from a third party instead of from an original scan or from the copyright owner directly, do we need to give them credit, or can we remove their web addresses and watermarks from non-free images?-[[User:Andrew c|Andrew&nbsp;c]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Andrew c|<sup>[talk]</sup>]] 17:25, 17 January 2009 (UTC)
:::LOL! Well with me there is no such thing as a "simple English summary" I guess. Because of an "unrelated to watermarking" discussion on the fair use of images I would be hesitant to remove anything from certain images. I will say that if it is a movie poster and a url or other credit appears on the image I would simply try and find a non-third party watermarked version and replace it. While this may not be the case in the examples given, a studio or other provider will sometimes allow use on a given website and it is watermarked to "track" it's use. So, in that case, Wikipedia would be claiming fair use of an image and, using the images you gave, credit is, indeed, given to that third party website as the source. [[:File:Msmt.jpg]] shows http://www.indiafm.com as the source, and that redirects to http://www.bollywoodhungama.com and the text under the FUR contains the wording of "Taken from IndiaFM.com and the press kit that was released there". One could figure if the studio released an e-press kit to that website it was why the poster is watermarked. For a explicit example of this type of watermark look at [[:File:BambiWoods DebbieDoesDallas Wikipedia.jpg]] which is not only watermarked but whoe description text says "Was scanned by VCX Ltd., Inc (copyright holder) and edited specifically for use on Wikipedia. Image clearly states VCX's ownership and the expressed permission to be used on Wikipedia." While this would seemingly fall under [[Wikipedia:CSD#I3|i3]] because it is clearly marked as "permission for this image to be used in Wikipedia. This permission does not extend to third parties" the fact it is tagged with a FUR negats use of that. On the other hand if the image is taken from an e-commerce site and also says "Order now", "pre-Order now" or "only 9.95 at URL" '''and''' it is not being used in an article about some form of advertising, fair use or not, it should fall under [[Wikipedia:CSD#G11|G11]], in which case there wouldn't be any real need to try and remove the offending text. More than likely though it could not be tagged as such and would have to be tagged using the [[:Template:Di-disputed fair use rationale]] saying that it was a form of advertisement and was not being used in an article about advertising. My main point here being that re-editing a fair use image simply to remove text falls outside the realm of our fair use policy and our current watermarking policy, as it were.

== What did I screw up? ==

I was directed here from the Help Desk.  So, I'm just copy/pasting my question over from there:

I'm not a lawyer.  

I uploaded [[:Image:Elisa Bridges 1994.jpg|this image]].  I wasn't sure what license to choose since none of them are very straight forward and just say "it's a picture of a dead person".  There's only the "historical or iconic image" option which mentions deceased persons.  Additionally, I'd like to know if I filled out the fair use rationale correctly.  I don't want to be bothered by some tag on my talk page in a few days saying that I didn't dot some i or cross some t.  That's what always happens whenever I add any image, so I'd like to nip that in the bud.

== Picture without copyright ==

I recently added a picture that I took myself that is not copyrighted.  However, it says that without copyright information that the photo will be deleted within a week.  I don't really care about the rights to the photo- I would just like to share it with the public in order to make the Tuscola High School page more enjoyable for wikipedia readers.  If I can leave this picture on here without obtaining a copyright license, that would be great- but if not, how would I go about getting a license and would it cost me anything?

The file is: [[:File:Tuscola3.JPG]]
:You don't have to 'obtain' a license. Since it's you that owns the copyright (it ''is'' copyrighted, by you. That's how copyright law works), you can release it under a license simply by stating that you do so. Depending on the license, this will allow other people to use the photo is certain ways while retaining some rights for yourself. However, if you don't care at all about the rights, you can state this by replacing the 'no copyright information' tag with {{tl|pd-self}}. Doing this will relinquish all of your rights over the photo and allow anyone to use it for any purpose. [[User talk:Algebraist|Algebraist]] 17:43, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

== [[Works of Zaha Hadid]] ==

Hi. I've begun work on the list [[Works of Zaha Hadid]], which I hope to bring to [[WP:FL]] status. I'd like to have opinions on whether it is considered admissible under our current application of [[WP:NFCC]] to use a fair use image for each non-realised project in the list, or for each realised building in a country without [[freedom of panorama]], as e.g. with [[:File:Zaha Hadid - Malevich's Tektonik.jpg]]. Thanks, <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 14:49, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

:Non-free images are not allowed in galleries. Having a table with thumbnailed images is basically a gallery. For an article about the work in question, then using a non-free image seems within our fair use policy (especially with a valid rational), but I'm pretty sure that use of non-free images in a list like this would not be permissible. -[[User:Andrew c|Andrew&nbsp;c]]&nbsp;[[User talk:Andrew c|<sup>[talk]</sup>]] 16:37, 17 January 2009 (UTC)

::Which part of [[WP:NFCC]] prohibits non-free images in galleries? At any rate, as I envision it, the list of works by that architect would not be a (mere) gallery; it would visually demonstrate the development of her work over time, the understanding of which would be substantially lessened without illustrations. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 00:02, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

:::It doesn’t prohibit galleries as such, but [[WP:NFCC#8]] says, “Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers' understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding.” If one of the works was so notable that it merited its own article, and if understanding the article depended on actually seeing a non-free image, then you could use the image in that separate article. But you can’t use non-free images just to illustrate a list. A non-free image of an artwork can be used only if it illustrates ''substantial critical commentary'', and only if it is highly significant to understanding that commentary.
:::The article as it stands, moreover, has an even worse problem. None of works in the article seems to fulfill Wikipedia’s [draft] [[Wikipedia:Notability (buildings, structures, and landmarks)|notability standard]]. —[[User:TEB728|teb728]] [[User talk:TEB728|t]] [[Special:Contributions/TEB728|c]] 00:50, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

::::The topic of the (very incomplete) article is the body of work of [[Zaha Hadid]]. Since architecture is a visual art, I submit that seeing images of the works is indispensable for the understanding of the topic. With respect to notability, the individual projects currently in the article are not notable (although most of the to-be-added ones will be), but that does not matter, since only the ''subject'' of the article - Hadid's work - must be notable, and as the work of a [[Pritzker Prize]] winner, it indubitably is. <small><span style="border:1px solid black;padding:1px;">[[User:Sandstein|<font style="color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;">'''&nbsp;Sandstein&nbsp;'''</font>]]</span></small> 01:00, 18 January 2009 (UTC)

::::::As it says in your {{tl|non-free 2D art}} tag, an image of non-free art can be used only for critical commentary on the work in question, on the artistic genre or technique of the work of art, or on the school to which the artist belongs. (Your text is just captions—not critical commentary.) And by [[WP:NFCC#8]] the use of the image must be essential to understanding the commentary. In order to have commentary on the work, the work itself (not just the artist) must be notable. (This pretty well precludes a complete list on an artist with any non-notable works.) On the other hand if the commentary is on the genre, technique, or school, then by [[WP:NFCC#3]] at most one non-free image could be used to illustrate the subject and even then (by [[WP:NFCC#1]]) only if no free image could illustrate the subject.

:This image has more than one issue. Most important the image says "(AP Photo/Tom Hevezi)" which strongly indicates the Associated Press owns and/or represents it and they are the one that need to be asked about it's use. As for requesting permission you should contact the Associated Press because that is who the image is credited too. I would ask A.P about the statement of "NO INTERNET/MOBILE USAGE WITHOUT FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION PREMIER LEAGUE(FAPL)LICENCE" as well. It may be possible to obtain permission, see [[:File:Marked-ap-letter.jpg]] for an example. I would try contacting Dawn Cohen from A.P at DCohen (at) ap (dot) org first and asking for permission for use here. Keep in mind though if they do give permission they are not going to re-license it for free use. As an aside, because of the credit to A.P, an with no OTRS on file from A.P, it would rule out any [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria|fair use]] claim as it's use here would "replace the original market role of the original copyrighted media". [policy criteria number 2] (See also [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-09-22/Dispatches|Wikipedia Signpost - September 22, 2008]], in particular the "example that fails/passes" sections.)

:::Depending on how old it is, but that would go for any image of a living person, being from a Yearbook or not.

Unless there was an article ''about'' the yearbook or ''about'' the image itself it is doubtful it would meet all 10 of the criteria. But you might consider what [[Wikipedia:Non-free content#Images_2|NFC - Unacceptable use]], Images, number 12 says.

== DoD disclaimer ==

Here's something interesting: [http://www.defenseimagery.mil/products/dodimagery.html].  The Dept of Defense lays out terms of usage for its photos - including requiring approval before using them in "commercial advertisement."  Are they mistaken, or allowed to do this, considering that works of the Federal Gov't are automatically PD?  -[[User:Seidenstud|Seidenstud]] ([[User talk:Seidenstud|talk]]) 06:34, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
:This is not really an answer, but I notice that the site’s [http://www.defenseimagery.mil/terms.html Terms of Use] page acknowledges (as expected) “Defense Department imagery and unclassified information is usually deemed to be in the public domain.” —[[User:TEB728|teb728]] [[User talk:TEB728|t]] [[Special:Contributions/TEB728|c]] 21:33, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
::Interesting issues. I know, for example, the wording on the same page of "As governed by DoD Directive 5040.5 (Alteration of Official DoD Imagery), the accuracy or integrity of our imagery must be maintained in accordance with established DoD imaging ethics." falls into line with the wording of some of the CCL licenses. I could gather that if you combine that with the personality rights disclaimer the commercial use would make sense as well. In other words say there is a recent image of the inauguration and a racist organization used it in an advertisement of some sort. I can see the cause for concern that would tie into all of their "terms of usage." The PD aspect is another side of it however but I am wondering how recent images figure into things and how "DoD Directive 5040.5 (Alteration of Official DoD Imagery)" figures into PD images? [[User:Soundvisions1|Soundvisions1]] ([[User talk:Soundvisions1|talk]]) 21:48, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
:::I think the "ethics" mentioned, apply exclusively to those working for the DoD, and not the public.  I think the restrictions of "commercial" use merely prevents images from being uses in advertisments, which would imply endorsement.  That's ok, since in general, you can't use images of a person or organization to imply a false endorsement (regardless of copyright).  I don't see any restriction on copyright, which is the only thing we care about.    --[[User:Thivierr|Rob]] ([[User talk:Thivierr|talk]]) 21:55, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
::::But it's worded so broadly as to transcend personality rights.  If it were only about personality rights, it would say that, or at least explain that it applies to photos with personality rights issues.  But a very large portion of DoD images do not contain people.  An aircraft carrier has no personality rights.  Yet, the way it is explicitly worded implies that such a boat photo would need clearance for use in advertisements- which is not consistent with treatment of PD works.  -[[User:Seidenstud|Seidenstud]] ([[User talk:Seidenstud|talk]]) 01:43, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

== Help with Musuem owned photograph ==

== Once again [[:Image:Noronic49.jpg]] ==

I have raised this before, but there has not been a useful answer.

The image [[:Image:Noronic49.jpg]] is tagged as being a Canadian image that is public domain in Canada, still under copyright in the US,
and usable in Wikipedia as fair use under US law.  My question is, once again, what makes this a Canadian image if it was taken in the US?
Is this just a mistake by the uploader or what?

Note that there is also a copy in Commons at [[:commons:File:Noronic49.jpg]] and this copy is being tagged as public domain '''in the US'''
because, it says, it is a work of the federal government!  If this is correct, the tagging of the first copy is doubly wrong.  But is it correct?

Either way, Wikipedia/Wikimedia's use of the image is legitimate, but it is important to state the right reason ''why'' it is legitimate.
Can someone find out what the story is here?

:The image in question is [[:File:Soul Food Taqueria back cover.jpg]]. The discussion you have on the talk page seems spot on. There is nothing unique about the back cover that the front cover doesn't illustrate in relation to the article text. Front cover depicts a "Soul Food" Taqueria by the renown graffiti artist. I can clearly see that in the front cover image. There is nothing in the description that would necessitate seeing the back cover, nor does the back cover increase my understanding significantly of the article text.

::The primary reasoning behind the [[WP:NFCC|non-free content criteria]] is to prevent unnecessary, decorative use of copyright images, or lazy use of replaceable images. If the article cogently discusses the art in question there should be little doubt that it is being validly used under fair use - the specific number of images is not itself a problem if they significantly improve the reader's understanding of the topic and cannot be replaced with a free equivalent. There are plenty of multi-sided pieces of album art that do fit this criterion.
::However, in this case I think Andrew C is right - there isn't much to be said about the back cover and hence the article to be honest does not really say much that needs illustrating with it.

== Fair Use rationale for File:WilliamACoulter2.jpg ==

I have uploaded [[:File:WilliamACoulter2.jpg]], and have been informed (via a bot) that it is in violation of [[Wikipedia:NFCC#10c|Non-free content criteria #10c]].  In order to bring the image into compliance with said rule, I have written a Fair Use rationale (which obviously I should have done previously, but was unclear about the necessity of so doing at the time).  I have affixed the Fair Use rationale to the Licensing section of the file page.  If its is necessary for me to place the text of the Fair Use rationale within some sort of tags, please do be so kind as to let me know, so that I may rectify that omission.  Otherwise, I am reasonably confident that my Fair Use rationale addresses the NFCC#10c issue, and that this image file should not be deleted on February 2nd, as it is otherwise presently scheduled to be.

Here is a copy of the text of my Fair Use rationale for the image file in question:


''Fair Use Rationale: The image is presently being used, and on my part is only intended for use, in the article on [[William A. Coulter]]. The image is of a painting by the late Mr. Coulter (deceased in 1936). The image is of the entire painting, as seems appropriate. The original painting itself belongs to a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but this person has granted the Paul and Linda Kahn Foundation permission to create a copyrighted image of the painting for use on their website. Linda Kahn has given me her explicit verbal permission to use this image, on condition it is attributed to the foundation (as of January 26th, 2009). The image is so attributed in the Coulter article.

''The image serves the purpose of presenting an example of Mr. Coulter's work, in that William A. Coulter's notability stems entirely from his work as a painter (and illustrator), and thus some representative sample of his work helps to illuminate his historical and cultural significance, as well as presenting the reader with a visual example of his artistic style. The image is of what is almost certainly (I do not believe this assertion is likely to be in dispute) his most celebrated painting, by virtue of its dramatic impact (it is his rendering of his personal witness to the events of the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, and specifically the subsequent fires which destroyed the majority of the city), yet never-the-less remains a representative sample of his work (particularly in so far as it is consistent with his history of creating paintings almost exclusively of a marine or nautical theme).

''I am unaware of any free content source of an equivalent image, and based on my searchings, and on my knowledge of the painting's status as privately-owned, am extremely skeptical that such an image could be located by anyone (although, obviously, it is impossible to make a definitive statement in that regard).

== [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] ==

I want to upload the image of the plaque commemorating the battle but I'm not sure if I can. It comes from [this site http://www.wikicu.com/Battle_of_Harlem_Heights], another wiki site, so I'm not sure if I can or not. Would it be okay to put it under fair use of an existing building if I cannont? Thanks. -[[User:Kieran4|Kieran4]] ([[User talk:Kieran4|talk]]) 02:14, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== [[George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie]] article image ==

I have limited skills when trying to determine the answer to copyright questions here in Wiki, this is doubly so when it comes to images, so I thought I'd post an enquiry here. The image attached to this article appears to simply be a photo shopped version of an image lifted directly off the Canadian Encyclopedia website, which is clearly copyrighted. The editor who posted it is claiming an exemption to copyright rules because the image is in the public domain because it's copyright has expired, which doesn't appear to me to be the case. is this a legitimate use of this image. If you choose to respond, please post to my talk page.  thanks [[User:Deconstructhis|Deconstructhis]] ([[User talk:Deconstructhis|talk]]) 04:38, 28 January 2009 (UTC)
:From the style of the image, the chances are high that it's a portrait from around the period that the subject was alive. If not, it can't have been painted much after he died. So yes, the claim that it is now in the public domain is very likely to be correct. Note, though, that sites routinely claim copyright over images that are in the public domain when they have no right to do so. The copyright claims of the Canadian Encyclopedia are irrelevant here.

== Horiata ==

Hello, my great grandfather [[User:Iliada]] wrote a song called Horiata. It is on the CD Axehastes Epitihies. I would like to upload the song so when people read the George Fteris article, they can listen to his song. The problem is, I don't know who owns or owned the copyright. I talked to my grandfather, and he said it had probably expired. Many times have I contacted the record company, but they have never responded. Wouldn't my great grandfather own the copyright since he wrote it? What should I do? --[[User:Iliada|Iliada]] ([[User talk:Iliada|talk]]) 13:54, 28 January 2009 (UTC)Iliada

:As a Greek work, copyright in the song would have belonged to your great grandfather, and will last for 70 years after his death (until the end of 2037).  Assuming no other transfer was made, ownership should have passed to his heirs (such as your grandfather).  ''However'', any recording of the song will also have a separate copyright on the performance, belonging to the performers or to the record company.  To upload the recording here, you'd either need permission for a free license from all of the copyright owners involved, or you'd have to follow the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content]] process.  --[[User:Davepape|dave pape]] ([[User talk:Davepape|talk]]) 16:29, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

== Public domain and non-PD licenses? ==

Since being uploaded, [[:File:DLKamtrakdepot.jpg]] has always had Creative Commons and GFDL license tags, but the uploader's description includes the statement, "I release rights to it to the public domain."  I understand that the license tags can be used together, but is it possible to combine PD with anything else?  And if not, which one(s) get(s) cancelled out?  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 20:24, 29 January 2009 (UTC)
:A PD declaration isn't compatible with any license because, by definition, releasing something to the PD represents a total and permanent relinquishing of all rights to the work.

== [[:File:Ljubica Sokić.jpg]] ==

Hi, in a message from [[User:Stifle]] I was informed that fair usage for [[:File:Ljubica Sokić.jpg]] is under suspicion. I am not into the matter of fair usage so I'm asking here; [[Ljubica Sokić]] has died last year so we can't make another photo in any way. I searched the net trying to find any free image, but the person, though very famous for her artist qualities and opus, wasn't really a Madonna type of person so there are only a few of her images available. This image, furthermore, is a screenshot from a TV program. Hoping I provided all the relevant information, I'm kindly asking you to help me in determining whether this image can be qualified as "fair use" in article [[Ljubica Sokić]] or not. Thank you in advance. --[[User:Дарко Максимовић|Дарко Максимовић]] ([[User_talk:Дарко Максимовић|talk]]) 12:58, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
:The first step is to look over the [[Wikipedia:Non-free content criteria]] policy. Make sure it meets all 10 of the required criteria. Second, once you have established that all 10 criteria are met, follow the guidelines at [[Wikipedia:Non-free use rationale guideline#Necessary components]] and fix the existing rationale. However, my suggestion, because this is a frame grab, would be to consider replacing the currently used generic {{tl|Non-free use rationale}} with [[:Template:ScreenshotU]] and make sure everything is filled out, making special note the the subject has passed away in the "replaceable" section.

::While you were posting that, I briefly filled out the relevant fields in the generic fair-use rationale and uploaded a reduced-size version to comply with [[WP:NFCC#3b]]. A better fair-use rationale as Soundvisions suggests would be a good idea, but believe I've solved the immediate problem. Additionally, I'm not sure about the suggestion of [[:Template:ScreenshotU]] due to the assertions it makes in the Replaceable section - it seems tailored specifically for articles about the TV program screenshotted, rather than a person who was on the program.~ <font color="#228b22">[[User:Mazca|'''m'''a'''z'''c'''a''']]</font> <sup>[[User_talk:Mazca|'''t''']]|[[Special:Contributions/Mazca|'''c''']]</sup> 18:23, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
:::You can add your own rationale, one does not need to use the default text. Also, because it is a frame grab from a television/video there does need to be some rationale as to why a frame grab can not be replaced by, say, an actual photograph.

== Titles of logos ==

I have a question regarding Image:Crown oil logo.PNG. Since that Company is called Crown Central Petroleum, they should name all their images Crown Central Petroleum or Crown Central LLC, or even Crown Central logo, or whatever. Right? Since there is a different comapany called exacly Crown Oil, (see Crown oil ltd article, or Image:Old Crown Oil logo.jpg or Image:Red Crown Oil Logo.JPG), I think they should be the only one's allowed to use the Crown Oil logo name only for their description? This also concerns the article - when you search for crown oil- you get crown central petroleum, to get the actual crown oil, you have to type in crown oil ltd, so typing in crown oil should take you to the actuall crown oil ltd article. Especially that their official website is www.crownoil.co.uk and they own the following domain names crown oil, crown oils-both take you to their website. In a short cut-typing in crown oil (whether it's for logos or articles) should take you to crown oil ltd logo or article; and typing in crown central petroleum should take you to crown central petroleum logo or article. Am I right?  [[User:Crownoil1947|Crownoil1947]] ([[User talk:Crownoil1947|talk]]) 12:29, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
:I see it didn’t prevent you from uploading [[:File:Red Crown Oil Logo.JPG]]. File names are not a big deal; don’t worry about it. While we have eachother’s attention, however, I have some concerns about ''your'' logos and username.
:*In the first place your logos are too large for non-free images. Wikipedia usually allows non-free images to be only about 300 pixels wide.
:*Also Wikipedia usually does not allow non-free images to be used in a gallery. Generally an article can have one non-free logo for identification. Use of a second logo is allowed only in extraordinary circumstances with substantial criticaly commentary on the image and where readers understanding of the article depends on seeing the image.
:*Also Wikipedia does not allow usernames that indicate company affiliation. You should change your username, or you may be blocked from editing.

:Who owns the copyright on the song? And who owns the copyright on the performance? (Sophia Vembo? Columbia Records?) Have those copyright owners granted a license which allows anyone to reuse the file for anything? If so, which [[free license]]? When you know the license, you can edit [[:File:Horiata.ogg]] and add the tag indicating the license. If you are not personally the copyright owner, see [[WP:COPYREQ]] for how to handle permission. —[[User:TEB728|teb728]] [[User talk:TEB728|t]] [[Special:Contributions/TEB728|c]] 02:12, 31 January 2009 (UTC) (The song is 510 sec long; so non-free use is out.)
== Proper information for Wikipedia screenshots? ==

I'm uploading some screenshots I made from Wikipedia pages, for a tutorial I plan to add shortly to Wikipedia.  I've got a number of other screenshots (for this and other tutorials) that I also want to upload; I'd like to make sure that I'm posting the correct information on the image/file pages I upload so that I don't have to individually, later, update each, which would be a royal pain. (I'm using [[commons:Commons:Tools#Commonist]], for what that's worth).

So my question is this: of the four screenshots that I've added so far, are any ''wrong'' (in the sense of incorrect or missing information about the image), and/or is one or more of these ''better'' in terms of source, copyright, and other information?

== Very old portrait of [[John Wesley Gilbert]] ==

So, I am writing an article on John Wesley Gilbert (you can check it out [[John Wesley Gilbert|here]]) and I have come across a historical photo of him. He was born in 1864, died in 1923. In the photo, he looks to be about 25-35 years old. Here is the [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pollard/earlyalumni.html website] I found it at. He's 3rd from the top. The website is part of the [[Brown University]] library system. My question is if this picture's copyright expired? If so, could I upload it here? If not, could I upload it as a fair use historical image? Which option should I choose to upload it? Thanks! [[User:SMSpivey|SMSpivey]] ([[User talk:SMSpivey|talk]]) 08:46, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
