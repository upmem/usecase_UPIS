'''''Totally Bill Hicks''''' is a [[video]], originally released in 1994, documenting the life and comedy of [[Bill Hicks]]. It consists of two parts: '''''Revelations''''', a recording of his last live performance in the [[United Kingdom]] made at the [[Dominion Theatre]],<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Cook |author-link= |title=Leave them laughing |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/jan/07/comedy |work= |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2003-07-01 |accessdate=2008-09-02 }}</ref> and '''''It's Just A Ride''''', a documentary about Hicks' life which features interviews with friends, admirers, and family.

In 2002 it became the first of Hicks' videos to be released on DVD,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2002/09/14/2079/bill_discs |title=Bill Discs |accessdate=2008-09-02 |last= |first= |date=2002-09-14 |work= |publisher=chortle.co.uk}}</ref> prompting one critic to comment on how topical the comedian's material had remained. His joke about the [[George H. W.
