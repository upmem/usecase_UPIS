'''Herman''' is an [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated community]] in [[L'Anse Township, Michigan|L'Anse Township]] of [[Baraga County, Michigan|Baraga County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]]. It was established in 1901 along a branch of the [[Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway]] approximately midway between [[Nestoria, Michigan|Nestoria]] and [[L'Anse, Michigan|L'Anse]].<ref name="GR2">{{GNIS|628133}}</ref>  A post office opened January 13, 1903, and was discontinued on December 5, 1970.<ref>{{gnis|2129295|Herman Post Office (historical)}}</ref>

The settlement was founded by Herman Keranen (born November 5, 1862 in Puolanka, Oulun Laani, Finland), who had been working in the lumber camps when he bought several {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} plots and constructed a crude log cabin. With the money he earned from lumbering, he established the largest and most productive farm in the area, which led to the community being named for him. For a number of years, the primary access to the area was via the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railroad Company. A school was built in 1903, and a post office followed in 1904. The Herman Athletic Association was organized in 1912, and a farmer's cooperative association in 1919. The area boasted at least one store and one mercantile business.<ref>{{cite book | title = Baragaland Bicentennial 1776-1976 | publisher = The Lumberjacks | year = 1976 | location = Baraga, Michigan }}</ref>

On December 19, 1996, the town received the single largest snowfall in Michigan history, with {{convert|30|in|cm}} falling in the single day.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dolce|first=Chris|title=50 States' Biggest Snow Days|url=http://www.weather.com/sports-rec/ski-conditions/50-states-biggest-snow-days-20130112?pageno=28|publisher=Weather.com|accessdate=18 January 2014|date=3 January 2014}}</ref>
