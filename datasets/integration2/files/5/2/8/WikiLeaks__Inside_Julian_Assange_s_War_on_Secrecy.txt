'''''WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy''''' is a 2011 book by British journalists [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] and [[Luke Harding (journalist)|Luke Harding]]. It is an account of [[Julian Assange]], [[WikiLeaks]], and the leak by [[Chelsea Manning]] of classified material to the website in 2010. It was published by [[Guardian Books]] in February 2011.<ref name=book />

Along with other sources, portions were adapted for the 2013 film ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]''.

==Content==
The book describes Assange's childhood and details about his work creating and expanding WikiLeaks. It explains how his surname comes from his stepfather, a "touring puppet theater owner", and not his biological father, a choice that Assange made himself.<ref name=ibtimes />

==Publication of the password==

Wikileaks gave ''The Guardian'' a copy of the unredacted leaks which included the names of informants and other sensitive information that was not intended for publication. This very sensitive information was protected by a large passphrase to ensure its secrecy.  

However, Leigh's book then published this password which led directly to the unredacted data being publicly available. <ref name=spiegel>{cite news | url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/leak-at-wikileaks-a-dispatch-disaster-in-six-acts-a-783778.html | title=A Dispatch Disaster in Six Acts}</ref>  It has been claimed that this led directly to the deaths of some of those informants.

{{quote|Assange wrote down on a scrap of paper:<br>''ACollectionOfHistorySince_1966_ToThe_PresentDay#''. "That's the password," he said. "But you have to add one extra word when you type it in. You have to put in the word 'Diplomatic' before the word 'History'. Can you remember that?"|David Leigh|WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy<ref name=huffingtonpost /><ref name=theatlanticwire />}}

In response ''The Guardian'' said "It's nonsense to suggest the Guardian's WikiLeaks book has compromised security in any way." According to ''The Guardian'', WikiLeaks had indicated that the password was temporary and that WikiLeaks had seven months to take action to protect the files it had subsequently decided to post online.<ref name=guardian /> ''The Guardian'' has not described what actions WikiLeaks could have taken given that the encrypted files had been leaked.  

Wikileaks did eventually publish the unredacted version.  The Guardian article about this failed to mention that the publication was after the password became widely known and was published so that informants could see what had been leaked and take action to protect themselves if necessary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/sep/02/wikileaks-publishes-cache-unredacted-cables | title=WikiLeaks publishes full cache of unredacted cables.}}</ref><ref name=spiegel/>

==Controversies as to content==
In response to the book's publication, [[WikiLeaks]] posted on [[Twitter]]: "''The Guardian'' book serialization contains malicious libels. We will be taking action."<ref>{{cite tweet|author=WikiLeaks|user=wikileaks|number=32867678527950848|title=The Guardian book serialization contains malicious libels.
