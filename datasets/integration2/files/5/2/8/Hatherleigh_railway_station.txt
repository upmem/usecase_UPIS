'''Hatherleigh Railway Station'''<ref>[http://www.hfstephens-museum.org.uk/pages/topics/budget/budget.htm Line engineer's residence]</ref> was a station<ref>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/bobbacktrack/page/vol19magazineindexbutton.html Feature details]</ref> on the [[North Devon and Cornwall Junction Light Railway]] between [[Torrington railway station|Torrington]] and [[Halwill Junction railway station|Halwill Junction]], serving the town of [[Hatherleigh]]. Hatherleigh was the largest place with a station on the line, though the town was almost two miles away. Like others on this line, the station itself was small but it was a passing place on the mainly single-track railway. The stationmaster at Hatherleigh also looked after the other stations on the line, even those, such as [[Petrockstow railway station|Petrockstow]] and [[Hole railway station|Hole]], that were staffed.

The line was opened in 1925 and was operated by the Southern Railway, though it remained a private line until it became part of the [[Southern Region of British Railways]] <ref>'''Branch Lines to Torrington''' Mitchell,V & Smith,K: Midhurst, Middleton Press,1994 {{ISBN|1-873793-37-5}}</ref> in 1948. The line closed in 1965<ref>"Discovering Britain's lost railways" Atterbury,P: Basingstoke, AA Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7495-6370-7}}</ref> as part of the [[Beeching Axe|Beeching]] proposals, goods services having been withdrawn the previous year.
