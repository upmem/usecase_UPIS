Doing a diligent search, I can find no significant third-party coverage of this location that establishes the notability of this organization.  The article contains no third-party sources whatsoever, and is not referenced, so I am putting this up for discussion.

* '''Keep'''. There is international mention e.g. at [http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/03/hackerspaces/ wired] and [http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2007/09/metalab-vienna-hacker-spa.html make online]. Further Metalab started the Hackerspaces.org index and was a huge part of inspiring the creation of hundreds of Hackerspaces worldwide in just a few years. Many international Hackerspaces credit Metalab in that regard (e.g. focusing on english sources: [http://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge_Vision Noisebridge] in SF, [http://blog.seanbonner.com/2009/10/13/crash-space-an-la-hackerspace/ Crashspace in LA], and [http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2007/11/vienna-hacking.html NYC Resistor]). Furthermore Metalab is specifically listed as Notable Hackerspace on the main [[Hackerspace]] article (out of over 400 known Hackerspaces worldwide). I completely agree that the article could use a lot more information and sources, but that's a reason to improve it, not a reason to delete an article about what has arguably been one of the most influential Hackerspaces worldwide. --[[User:PaulBohm|PaulBohm]] ([[User talk:PaulBohm|talk]]) 19:05, 17 February 2011 (UTC)
* '''Keep'''. Specifically in the Luxembourgish web: [http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&q=metalab+site:.lu&aq=f&aqi=&aql=f&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.1,or.&fp=6310ac461fb3c07d Metalab in .lu] - Metalab has proven inspirational not only for our beginnings but constantly as a reference in the domain of HackerSpaces. This is exactly what the international context is about and makes Metalab a permanent reference for new HackerSpaces. --[[User:SteveClement|SteveClement]] ([[User talk:SteveClement|talk]]) 22:41, 17 February 2011 (UTC)

* "Keep" There is no proper reasoning why this page does not deserve to be included in the wikipedia. Your exclusionism just drives me nuts. Please leave.

* '''Keep''' and take a minute to think about if your deletion practice might be one of the reasons WP bashing has become so popular lately.

* '''keep''' multiple mentions in English and German-speaking media, plus see above. --[[User:Zeno Gantner|zeno]] ([[User talk:Zeno Gantner|talk]]) 09:36, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

* as I am involved with the space, I will not vote here. I should not (if I remember the WP rules correctly) edit the article. There is an english source in [http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/03/hackerspaces/ wired] that should be mentioned in the article though. [[User:-fin|-fin]] ([[User talk:-fin|talk]]) 12:04, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - even the very exclusionist german wikipedia has an article about Metalab. (Now, thats not a call to delete it there, too, just to make sure!) -- riot
*:FWIW, I don't haunt the German wiki, since I am an American.  Moreover, this discussion did exactly as I intended - other editors found sources that I could not (probably beacuse I was looking in the wrong places).  Nevertheless, I find it strange that all of a sudden two IP's and just happen to chime in (and a bit uncivilly too, I might add). If the found sources were added to the article, the issues I raised would be moot.

*'''Keep''' - Perhaps some additions to the links above: many events have accompanying activities in the metalab, which also the city of [[Vienna]] mentions on their website [http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/msg/2009/0827/011.html], [http://www.wien.gv.at/rk/msg/2008/0703/020.html]. Also the student's representation for computer science at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] publishes invitations to events at Metalab [http://www.fsinf.at/newsletter/0903], [http://www.fsinf.at/node/679], [http://www.fsinf.at/node/723]. I'd say Metalab is well integrated into Viennas hacker-culture. -- [[User:Alerion|Alerion]] ([[User talk:Alerion|talk]]) 12:43, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' - The metalab hackerspace Vienna triggers the whole hackerspace movement in Europe. There are more than 30 articles listed on their home page [http://metalab.at/wiki/index.php?title=Pressespiegel] from well-known media sources ([[Le_monde]], [[ORF]]). The deletion policy is quite clear on the topic. The metalab is a notable place affecting the history of the hackerspace movement and there are many sources reflecting that. The article must be kept and I have no affiliation to the metalab. [[User:AlexandreDulaunoy|AlexandreDulaunoy]] ([[User talk:AlexandreDulaunoy|talk]]) 09:24, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

* '''Keep''' - As many commentators before me have already pointed out, [[Metalab]] is not simply one of many cursory hackerspaces but one of those laying the foundations for the whole hackerspaces movement. Furthermore, that an article does not list enough references should not give rise to a deletion request. One should start off by asking for contributions from participants. (There are ample templates more suitable to improve the relevancy of an article than trying to have it deleted.) --[[User:Clausekwis|Clausekwis]] ([[User talk:Clausekwis|talk]]) 12:13, 20 February 2011 (UTC)
