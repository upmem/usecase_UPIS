==Career==
Rajeev Taranath was born in [[Bangalore]] on 17 October 1932. He received his initial training in vocal music from his father [[Pandit Taranath]].

Although Rajeev held a PhD in literature, he decided to give up his career as a Professor and Head of English Literature at [[Regional Engineering College, Tiruchirappalli]] (REC-T), which was later renamed as National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT-T), and then went to [[Calcutta]], where he began his musical training under the tutelage of [[Ali Akbar Khan]]. Rajeev continued to learn from his Guru till Khan's demise in 2009. He has also had guidance from [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Annapurna Devi]], [[Nikhil Banerjee]] and [[Aashish Khan]]. He has received some of India's highest national honors including the 2019 [[Padma Sri]] award and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] in 1999-2000. He researched and published the Teaching Techniques of the Maihar-Allauddin Gharana, as a Ford Foundation scholar (1989 to 1992).

He is respected for his in-depth understanding as he unfolds the raga, the tonal quality and power of his strokes. His distinctive style shows technical excellence, imaginative power and emotional range. According to the New York Times, "RAJEEV TARANATH'S sarod improvisations Sunday at Soundscape mixed the spiritual and the spirited".
