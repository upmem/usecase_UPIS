She was born in [[Çemişgezek]], a small mountain town in [[Dersim Province]] in [[Turkey]] and fled to [[İstanbul]] in 1992. She studied ''saz'' and ''türkü'' singing in an influential music school in Istanbul, the Arif Sağ Müsik.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/musicinturkeyexp0000bate/page/91|title=Music in Turkey: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture|last=Bates|first=Eliot|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-539415-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/musicinturkeyexp0000bate/page/91 91]|language=en}}</ref> In 2004 she released the album ''Keçe Kurdan'' on [[Kalan Müzik]] label. ''Keçe Kurdan'' was banned in 2005 due to the fact that two words in the song, ''Keçe'' (Girl) and ''Ceng'' (battle),<ref name=":0" /> according to a court in Diyarbakır, would encourage women to leave their partners, go to the mountains and hence the words promote division. The following year the ban was lifted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Music/Bringing-it-home-from-Kurdistan|title=Bringing it home from Kurdistan|website=The Jerusalem Post {{!}} JPost.com|access-date=2020-01-30}}</ref>

Aynur is a vocal artist who specializes in infusing traditional Kurdish folk music with a contemporary sensibility influenced by Western music. Her stunning vocal style and success in the music world has allowed her to become a prominent representative of Kurdish people in Turkey and throughout the world. She has taken the wealth of Kurdish oral tradition to the international stage that many of them at least 300 years old. Aynur has collaborated with numerous musicians, including [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and the [[Silk Road Ensemble]], [[Kayhan Kalhor]], [[Javier Limón]], [[Kinan Azmeh]], Nerderland Blazers Ensemble and NDR Bigband and many more. Meanwhile, she appeared in [[Fatih Akin|Fatih Akın]]'s documentary movie “ [[Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul|Crossing the Bridge / The Sound of Istanbul]] ” as a singer and was also part of the documentary film about Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble named "[[The music of Strangers]]" directed by [[Morgan Neville]] in 2015.

In 2017, Aynur received the Master of Mediterranean Music Award in the category of “Mediterranean Women in Action” from the [[Berklee Mediterranean Music Institute]]. This award recognized Aynur's efforts to preserve and reinterpret Kurdish folk music, which has transformed her into an influential role model for other women artists on the Mediterranean music scene who are seeking to share their voices.

''Whenever she takes a melody, she makes it her own, transforming it into something beautiful, and every note, every microtone, every word reaches depth and unparalleled beauty. She is a reason to love live music for centuries.”  –[[Javier Limón|Javier Limon]]
