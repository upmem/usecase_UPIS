'''George Alexander Kennedy''' (17 May 1901{{snd}}15 August 1960), was an American [[sinologist]] known for his studies of [[classical Chinese]] and for his teaching of Chinese to students.

==Life and career==
George Kennedy was born on 17 May 1901 in [[Moganshan]], [[Zhejiang Province]], China, where his parents Alexander and Ada Kennedy were serving as [[Protestant]] missionaries.  Although his family spoke English at home, Kennedy grew up speaking the local Chinese dialect, a form of [[Wu Chinese]], and often said that Chinese was his native language.{{sfnp|Honey|2001|p=265}}  The Kennedy family left China in 1918 after George's father and brother Fred died less than a month apart.  They returned to the United States, where Kennedy attended the [[College of Wooster]].  From 1922 to 1925 he studied theology at the [[Western Theological Seminary]] and the [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York]].  During this time he became friends with [[Luther Carrington Goodrich]], who later became professor of Chinese at [[Columbia University]].

He returned to China in 1926 and taught English and Chinese in [[Shanghai]].  In 1932, Kennedy went to the [[University of Berlin]], where he studied Chinese and [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] under [[Otto Franke (sinologist)|Otto Franke]] and [[Erich Haenisch]].  In 1937, Kennedy completed his [[Ph.D.]] with dissertation on the role of confession in Chinese law.  He had previously returned to the United States and worked in the Orientalia department of the [[Library of Congress]] under [[Arthur W. Hummel, Sr.]], writing 72 entries in Hummel's biographical dictionary, ''[[Eminent Chinese of the Ch'ing Period]]''.  In 1936 he began teaching Chinese at [[Yale University]].  He was made an assistant professor in 1937, an associate professor in 1943, and full professor in 1954, the rank he held upon his sudden death in 1960.{{sfnp|Honey|2001|p=265}}  During [[World War II]], Kennedy served as the director of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]] at Yale from 1942 to 1944.{{sfnp|Honey|2001|p=265}}

In 1960, Kennedy was traveling in Asia visiting some friends and members of his family.  In early August 1960, Kennedy planned to return to the United States, and boarded a ship in [[Yokohama, Japan]], bound for [[San Francisco]].  During the voyage, Kennedy, who had not been feeling well but had not sought medical attention, died of a heart attack.  An autopsy revealed that he had a number of large tumors in his body but had chosen not to have any cancer treatments.

Kennedy was the principal author of the [[Yale Romanization of Mandarin]].
