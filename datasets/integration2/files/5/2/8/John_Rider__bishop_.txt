'''John Ryder''' (1562–1632) was a [[lexicographer]] who published an English-Latin Dictionary that was widely used in the 17th century. A favourite of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], he was [[Deans of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], and the [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] [[List of Anglican Bishops of Killaloe|Bishop of Killaloe]].

==Birth==
John Ryder was born in 1562, the son of Edward de Rythre of [[Carrington, Greater Manchester|Carrington]], Cheshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lawson|2009|p=137.}}</ref> His great-grandfather, Thomas de Rythre (d.1552) of [[Scarcroft]], was [[Cofferer]] to the Household of [[King Edward VI]] and a first cousin of [[Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland]], through their grandfather Sir William de Rythre (1408–1476) of [[Ryther cum Ossendyke|Ryther]] Castle, [[Scarcroft]] and [[Harewood Castle]]. Bishop Ryder was the first of his family to spell his name Ryder, rather than de Rythre/Ryther. His first cousin, Mary Ryther (daughter of the [[Lord Mayor of London]]) and her husband Sir [[Thomas Lake]] were the great-grandparents of the [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|Duchess of Chandos]].

==Career in the Church==

Ryder was educated at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] (B.A, M.A.).<ref>[https://www.british-history.ac.uk/alumni-oxon/1500-1714/pp1277-1295 Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Rokeby-Ryves]</ref> Afterwards he was Rector of [[Bermondsey]] (1581–1583) and of [[South Ockendon]] (1583–1590). At [[Oxford]], 1589, he published his English-Latin [[Dictionary]]. He added over four thousand words which hitherto had no record of translation.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} In this huge undertaking, he was greatly aided by his friend [[Henry Radclyffe, 4th Earl of Sussex]].

Soon afterwards he published an account of the [[Spanish Armada]] in Ireland.

Through his relation, [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]], he was appointed to the valuable living of [[Winwick, Lancashire]]. Ryder also held the [[patronage]] of [[Elizabeth I of England]] and was described as "a great, personal favourite" of hers. Through her he was first appointed to a [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|prebend]] in the Chapter of [[Dublin]] to pacify the more senior clerics in Ireland so that he could be officially eligible for the position of [[Deans of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin]], which the Queen desired for him. In 1597, following the death of [[Richard Meredith (bishop)|Bishop Richard Meredith]] and in accordance with Her Majesty's wishes, he was appointed Dean of St. Patrick's, a position he later exchanged for that of [[Archdeacon of Meath]] in 1608. In 1598, the Queen gave him the [[Prebendary]] of [[Geashill]], which fell under the [[Kildare Cathedral|Cathedral of Kildare]]. In 1612, he was consecrated [[Bishop of Killaloe]], a position he held until his death, 12 November 1632. He is buried at [[Killaloe Cathedral]], [[Co. Clare]]. He left behind him the "character of a learned and religious prelate".

==Scholarship==

Between 1599 and 1614 Ryder continued a public controversy with [[Henry Fitzsimon]], an Irish [[Jesuit]], on the subject of the relationship between contemporary [[Protestantism]] and the Christianity of the early Church. Although Fitzsimon ran the risk of being prosecuted, and potentially sentenced to death, for [[heresy]] or [[treason]], he was "merely bundled out of the country", suggesting, it has been said, that, "Dublin would appear to have been a safer place to voice dissent than London, Paris, or Rome" (Brian Jackson, in Ciaran Brady and Jane Ohlmeyer, eds, ''British Interventions in Early Modern Ireland'' [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005], p.&nbsp;103).From 1599 to 1614, Ryder had been joined by the [[Primate of All Ireland]], [[James Ussher]], and [[Meredith Hanmer]] in succeeding to have Fitzsimon expelled from Ireland.

Besides his famous English-Latin Dictionary (1589) and ''Account of the Spanish Armada in Ireland'', Ryder was the author of two further publications: ''A Friendly Caveat to Irish Catholiques Concerning Christ's Corporall Presence etc.'' (1602) and ''A Claim of Antiquity in behalf of the Protestant Religion'' (London, 1608). He published a postscript to the latter following an attack by his opponent in this controversy, [[Henry Fitzsimon]].

==Family==

Ryder was married to Fridswold Crosby, who died 26 January 1615, the daughter of Edward Crosby of Crosby Place, [[Staffordshire]]. Their only son, Thomas Ryder, was Secretary to the British [[Legation]] at Paris and the father of Henry Ryder (d.1695) of Wyanstown, [[Co. Dublin]] who also became the [[Bishop of Killaloe]]. Their eldest daughter, Jane, married Walter Weldon, Member of Parliament for [[Athy]].
