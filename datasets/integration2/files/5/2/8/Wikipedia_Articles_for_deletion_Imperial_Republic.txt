===[[Imperial Republic]]===
Was [[Wikipedia:Proposed deletion|proposed for deletion]] ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Imperial_Republic&diff=38161086&oldid=38044225 nomination]), but one of the article's primary authors removed the tag.  Nevertheless, it's an online rpg played on a forum that claims 83 total players, and doesn't come close to meeting our [[WP:WEB|our notability guidelines]]. &#8212;[[User:Cryptic|Cryptic]] [[User talk:Cryptic|(talk)]] 18:10, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
