EDP Renewables North America (former names: Zilkha Renewable Energy and Horizon Wind Energy) and its subsidiaries develop, construct, own, and operate [[Wind farm|wind farms]] and [[Photovoltaic power station|solar parks]] throughout North America.

Headquartered in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], with 53 wind farms and five solar parks, EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA) operates more than 7,200 megawatts (MW) of [[renewable energy]] projects in 14 U.S. states (Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, South Carolina, Washington, and Wisconsin) as well as in Canada and Mexico.

EDPR NA is owned by [[EDP Renováveis|EDP Renewables]] (EDPR), a global leader in the [[renewable energy]] sector that develops, constructs, owns, and operates renewable electricity generation facilities. EDPR has grown significantly in recent years and is currently present in 14 countries (Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). EDPR is the world’s fourth-largest wind energy producer, and EDPR NA represents EDPR’s largest market in terms of installed capacity and production.

==History==
In 2005, the company (then called Zilkha Renewable Energy, and owned by [[Selim Zilkha]] and [[Michael Zilkha]]) was purchased by investment bank [[Goldman Sachs]] for an undisclosed sum and renamed Horizon Wind Energy. In 2007, the company was acquired by [[Energias de Portugal]] for $2.15 billion<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-edp-horizon-idUSL2715639720070327|title=EDP to buy $2.2 bln U.S. Horizon Wind Energy|date=2007-03-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-06-28|language=en}}</ref> and later renamed EDP Renewables North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-eng.com/articles/2011/07/horizon-wind-energy-changes-name.html|title=Horizon Wind Energy changes name|website=www.power-eng.com|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>
