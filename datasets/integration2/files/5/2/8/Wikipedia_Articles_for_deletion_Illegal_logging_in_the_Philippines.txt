*'''Keep''' The article is very poor, but the topic is an important one and noted as such in good sources. [[User:Borock|Borock]] ([[User talk:Borock|talk]]) 19:59, 8 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I removed copyvio text. The article is now no more than a copy of [[Illegal logging]] with 3 references. It is easy to conceive that there might be a decent article entitled [[Illegal logging in the Philippines]], but the only way to get there would be to start over. --[[User:Pontificalibus|<font style="color:#555555"><strong>Pontificalibus</strong></font>]] ([[User talk:Pontificalibus#top|talk]]) 21:22, 8 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' and start over. Unlike [[Illegal logging in Madagascar]], this article is rather vague and generic, with very little specific mention of the Philippines. There's little worth salvaging except possibly the references. [[User:Clarityfiend|Clarityfiend]] ([[User talk:Clarityfiend|talk]]) 00:18, 9 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Comment'''. I agree with the above comments except for that of the nominator. I will try and rustle up a [[Deforestation in the Philippines]] article and then this page should be redirected to it. -- [[User:Alan Liefting|Alan Liefting]] ([[User_talk:Alan_Liefting|talk]]) - 08:51, 11 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' without prejudice to a proper article existing on the subject. [[User:MLA|MLA]] ([[User talk:MLA|talk]]) 23:13, 12 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' - Insufficient references provided with reliable sources for subject of article to meet [[WP:GNG]]. --[[User:RightCowLeftCoast|RightCowLeftCoast]] ([[User talk:RightCowLeftCoast|talk]]) 04:51, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
