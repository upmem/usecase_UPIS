*'''Delete''' as a neologism. The sole reference provided looks like advertising for the book mentioned therein.  --[[User:Kinu|Kinu]] 20:00, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as non-notable, unverifiable neologism, i.e. protologism, and appears to be an advert. [[User:Stifle|Stifle]] 01:05, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. [[User:Amcfreely|Amcfreely]] 06:27, 6 February 2006 (UTC)
