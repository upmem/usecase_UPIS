The fight was ruled a [[technical draw]] after the round. Crolla was unsure whether Díaz had the desire to continue. He told Sky Sports, “I’m not speaking bad of Gamaliel Díaz. It’s a technical draw, the doctor ruled he was unable to continue, but I felt like he was happy with that.“ Promoter Eddie Hearn later went on to say, “I’ll speak to the doctor because if the fighter chooses not to continue then I don’t believe it’s a technical draw. If the referee stops the fight on the advice of the doctor then it is a technical draw, but it looked like he didn’t want to come out. I think he was happy to accept the technical draw.”<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12040/9469552/anthony-crolla-forced-to-settle-for-draw-after-clash-of-heads|title=Anthony Crolla forced to settle for draw after clash of heads with Gamaliel Diaz|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2017-11-24|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Lys Alexandrov|title=Anthony Crolla vs Gamaliel Diaz 13 09 2014|date=2014-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd62H8sT6yU|accessdate=2017-11-24}}</ref>

==== Crolla vs. Pérez I, II ====
Crolla received his first opportunity at a world title against [[List of WBA world champions|WBA lightweight]] champion [[Darleys Perez|Darleys Pérez]] on 18 July 2015 at the [[Manchester Arena]] in [[Manchester]]. The fight ended in a controversial split decision draw. Crolla seemed like the clear winner after Pérez twice had pointed deducted for low blows. One judge had the fight 116-111 for Crolla, the other two judges scored it a 113-113 draw. In the post fight, Crolla told Sky Sports, "I'm bitterly disappointed I've not got the world title take to home with me.

A day later, promoter Eddie Hearn stated that he would speak to the WBA to get an immediate rematch ordered. Hearn believed Crolla by at least four rounds and his trainer Joe Gallagher saw him win by two rounds. Hearn told Sky Sports, "I've emailed the WBA complaining about the points decision and asking for an immediate rematch. If there were two points deducted how could they have given the fight to Perez by two rounds? No way."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/13282019/eddie-hearn-left-sickened-anthony-crolla-darleys-perez-draw-demands-rematch-wba|title=Hearn left 'sickened' by Crolla decision|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref>

====Crolla vs. Barroso====
On 11 March 2016, Sky Sports announced that Crolla would make his first defence of his WBA lightweight title against [[mandatory challenger]] [[Ismael Barroso]] (19-0-2, 18 KOs) at the Manchester Arena on 7 May. Barroso was known for displaying his punch power in a chilling knockout win over [[Kevin Mitchell (boxer)|Kevin Mitchell]] in December 2015. Talking about Barroso, Crolla said, "For some strange reason, there was a few people out there who thought I was going to try and swerve Ismael Barroso. Listen when you're world champion, you try and fight the best challengers out there." At the time, Crolla was also offered £500,000 to fight the winner of WBO champion [[Terry Flanagan (boxer)|Terry Flanagan]] vs. Derry Matthews, which was taking place on 12 March. Crolla stated that with the offer, he would have had to surrender his WBA title. He was not likely to do so, just for a big payday.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10200328/anthony-crolla-will-defend-wba-title-against-ismael-barroso-in-manchester|title=Anthony Crolla will defend WBA title against Ismael Barroso in May at Manchester Arena|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/crolla-vs-barroso-officially-set-7-manchester--102270|title=Crolla vs. Barroso Officially Set, May 7 In Manchester - Boxing News|website=www.boxingscene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12184/10251327/crolla-vs-barroso-anthony-crolla-not-first-briton-to-make-daunting-first-defence|title=Anthony Crolla not the first Briton to make a daunting first defence|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}</ref> Crolla won the fight, retaining the WBA title. The opening five rounds saw Crolla take a lot of clean shots. Barroso began to tire following round 6, and Crolla took control. Crolla hurt Barroso with a right to the head that staggered him. He was able to land several more right hands before the end of the round. Barroso looked as though he had nothing left. In round 7, Barroso landed some shots, but lacked the power at this stage to hurt Crolla. Crolla landed several hard shots before dropping Barroso with a right to the body. Barroso got to one knee but wasn’t able to beat the count. At the time of stoppage, Crolla was behind on all three judges scorecards (56–58, 55–59 twice).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/36237361|title=Anthony Crolla stops Ismael Barroso to retain WBA lightweight title|last=Sport|first=Alan Jewell BBC|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2016-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/10273934/anthony-crolla-retains-world-title-with-knockout-of-ismael-barroso|title=Anthony Crolla retains world title with knockout of Ismael Barroso|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en}}</ref>

Both fighters embraced in the end, as they had shown mutual respect for one another in the build up. In the post fight, Crolla said, "I thought I definitely did enough.

=== Career from 2019–present ===

==== Crolla vs. Lomachenko ====
In December 2018, after Lomachenko successfully unified at lightweight, [[Top Rank]] president Todd duBoef announced Lomachenko would return to the ring on 12 April 2019 at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]] headlining Friday night Top Rank Boxing on [[ESPN]]. With [[Richard Commey]] and [[Isa Chaniev]] set to fight for the vacant IBF lightweight title, it was highly likely that the winner would fight Lomachenko in what would be Lomachenko's second unification fight. Top Rank intended to finalize the deal with promoter [[Lou DiBella]], which would see Commey vs. Chaniev take place on 2 February 2019 at the [[Ford Center at The Star|Ford Center]] in [[Frisco, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/25514026|title=Top Rank: Lomachenko's return set for April 12|date=2018-12-12|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref> By the end of January 2019, purse bids for Lomachenko vs. Crolla were pushed back two days to 6 February 2019 with the minimum bid being $150,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lomachenko-vs-crolla-purse-bid-pushed-back-february-6--135807|title=Lomachenko vs. Crolla Purse Bid Pushed Back To February 6|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> 

Commey defeated Chaniev to become the new IBF lightweight champion, however picked up a hand injury during the fight. His promoter Lou DiBella advised Top Rank, Commey would be out of training for a minimum  of two months. This prompted Top Rank to start searching for a new opponent for Lomachenko.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/commey-out-6-8-weeks-another-foe-sought-lomachenko--136096|title=Commey Out 6-8 Weeks, Another Foe Sought For Lomachenko|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> On 20 February it was announced that Lomachenko would defend his WBA (Super), WBO and The Ring titles against Crolla at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] on 12 April 2019. The bout, including the full undercard would be streamed live and exclusive on [[ESPN+]], to mark the one year anniversary of the streaming service. The fight was made official a week later with ticket information. The bout would mark Crolla's first time fighting in USA, having only fought once previously outside of his native UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/26033915|title=Lomachenko to defend title vs. Crolla on April 12|date=2019-02-20|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lomachenko-crolla-official-april-12-staples-center-espn--136570|title=Lomachenko-Crolla Official For April 12, Staples Center, ESPN+|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-03}}</ref> It was reported that Lomachenlo would earn $1.2 million, but guaranteed closer to $3.2 million.

In round 3, Lomachenko became overwhelmingly dominant while forcing Crolla to spend a majority of his time against the ropes. With 11 seconds left in the round, Lomachenko's combination was interrupted by referee Jack Reiss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/13/18308880/knockout-watch-vasyl-lomachenko-obliterate-anthony-crolla-in-the-fourth-round-espn-top-rank-boxing|title=Highlights! Lomachenko Scores Face-Plant KO In Dominant Title Defense|last=Hiergesell|first=Dan|date=2019-04-13|website=MMAmania.com|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref> At first glance Lomachenko, and even the crowd, thought it looked as if Reiss had stopped the fight, causing Lomachenko to celebrate by jumping on the corner ropes. However, Reiss immediately corrected the misunderstanding and forced out commissioners who had climbed into the ring, and resumed the fight after a 10 second count for Crolla — although with 1 second left, the round effectively ended immediately. Between rounds 3 and 4, Reiss explained he'd not actually waved off the fight, and instead called a technical knockdown — he was seen immediately pointing and saying "down". He explained he was accounting for the ropes' aid to Crolla's ability to stand, since if the ropes had been absent Crolla would've been down and it is against the rules for a fighter to have any outside support in standing throughout the entire duration of the fight, thus justifying his rarely used but sanctioned technical knockdown. Because of this Crolla continued on into round 4 where after briefly trying to rally back he was knocked down in second 52 by a right hook to the temple. Crolla fell to the canvas face-first, unable to break his fall. After what looked to be a 3 to 4 second count by Reiss, the fight was waved off, giving Lomachenko the win and retaining his sanctioned belts. Crolla was unable to participate in the post-fight interviews, but did not decide to immediately go to hospital.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/11692187/lomachenko-vs-crolla-anthony-crolla-knocked-out-by-pound-for-pound-king-vasyl-lomachenko|title=Lomachenko vs Crolla: Anthony Crolla knocked out by pound-for-pound king Vasyl Lomachenko|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/47918548|title=Anthony Crolla: Briton loses to Vasyl Lomachenko in Los Angeles|date=2019-04-13|access-date=2019-04-15|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boxingscene.com/lomachenko-demolishes-crolla-four-round-results--137911|title=Lomachenko Demolishes Crolla in Four Round Mismatch|website=BoxingScene.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> According to CompuBox Stats, Lomachenko landed 72 of 249 shots (29%), and Crolla landed only 12 of his 96 thrown (13%), this included 7 power shots, compared to Lomachenko's 58 power shots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/26510483|title=Lomachenko crushes Crolla by knockout in 4th|date=2019-04-13|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> After the fight, Crolla said, "I don't want to go out like that but the end is near."
