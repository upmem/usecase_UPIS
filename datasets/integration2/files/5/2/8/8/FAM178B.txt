== Expression ==
FAM178B is most highly expressed in the [[skeletal muscle]] and brain tissues<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.genomatix.de/|title=Gene2Promoter|last=|first=|date=|website=ExPasy|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.The structure in which it is highly concentrated is in the [[corpus callosum]] of the brain.<ref name=":2" /> Additionally, it is of high levels in the [[trigeminal nerve]] and spinal cord. Further, there is also high concentrations of the gene found near the heart, testes and olfactory regions. 

According to the [[Allen Brain Atlas]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mouse.brain-map.org|title=Allen Brain Atlas|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> the olfactory regions, and the [[hippocampus]] of the mouse brain showed the greatest expressions of the gene when tested experimentally.

Below is a table that shows the protein modifications that could be potentially made to FAM178B, and the potential effects of these modifications on the protein itself:.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expasy.org/proteomics/protein-protein_interaction|title=ExPASy: SIB Bioinformatics Resource Portal - Categories|website=www.expasy.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>

<br />
== Homology and Evolution ==
An important paralog of the gene is SLF2, which plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by regulating post replication repair of UV-damaged DNA. It also helps maintain genomic stability.<ref>Räschle, M., Smeenk, G., Hansen, R. K., Temu, T., Oka, Y., Hein, M. Y., … Mann, M. (2015). DNA repair. Proteomics reveals dynamic assembly of repair complexes during bypass of DNA cross-links. ''Science'', ''348''(6234), 1253671. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1253671</nowiki></ref> There are 74 known [[Homology (biology)|orthologs]] of the protein, and it can be traced back as far back as crustaceans.<ref name=":0" /> FAM178B is heavily found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The ortholog space for the protein FAM178B is quite large as it can be traced back 794 millions of years ago (mya) to mollusks with the apple snail, and Pacific Oyster. There are 134 known orthologs of FAM178B. However, the protein is not found in arthropods, or insects, which is interesting because those organisms also existed in that time period meaning that it was conserved across some taxa, but not others. The protein is most readily found in primates, and other non-primate mammals. The protein is also conserved across reptiles, some bony fish, and cartilaginous fish, and birds.   

Below is a table illustrating some of the orthologs for FAM178B using [[BLAST]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi|title=BLAST: Basic Local Alignment Search Tool|website=blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> and [[BLAT (bioinformatics)|BLAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat|title=Human BLAT Search|website=genome.ucsc.edu|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref>

== Interacting Proteins ==
There are 2 proteins that have high predicted values of interaction with FAM178B: LRSAM 1 and ZNF598.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentha.uniroma2.it/|title=mentha: the interactome browser|website=www.mentha.uniroma2.it|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> [[LRSAM1]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q6UWE0|title=LRSAM1 - E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase LRSAM1 - Homo sapiens (Human) - LRSAM1 gene & protein|website=www.uniprot.org|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> is also known as leucine rich repeat and sterile alpha motif protein 1. The value for the protein is .29 and the evidence is physical from hybrid pooling approaches. LRSAM1 was previously known as Tsg-associated ligase and is located on the LRSAM1 gene. Mutations have been associated with periphery neuropathy, and sensory disorders. It is highly expressed in the spinal cord, as is FAM178B. There is currently no known structure for the protein. [[ZNF598]] is a zinc finger protein and the value is .13. It plays a key role in ribosome quality control. The predicted structures are below for both proteins.
