== Elucidation ==

Good morning.
Perhaps you are the right people to solve this question. I'll come straight to the point: the photo of the game in question is Italy - West Germany, the final of the World Cup in 1982.
If you notice the football goal, from the back, you will see that the net has been fixed "hermetically" so as not to let the ball out, of course. But I ask myself: is there a pillar - pass me the term - under the pitch, then covered and rolled up, where the net is well "fastened"?
Thank you.

:Rather than linking to the search results, could you link to an actual picture? I clicked on a few of the ones your link sent me to, but none of them seemed to have anything like what you're describing. [[User:Matt Deres|Matt Deres]] ([[User talk:Matt Deres|talk]]) 14:15, 17 February 2019 (UTC)

I'm not familiar with the images, but also the links could be enough, they also open photos. This could go. They are always the World Cup in 1982, the pariaquestion this time is Italy Brazil, the quarterfinal. The system is the same, I refer to the footbal goal nets.

:The bottom rear of the net at Sarria stadium appears to be pegged to the ground at intervals of 5 net squares. Suitable plastic and steel pegs are [http://www.networldsoccer.com/soccer-net-accessories.html sold here by a UK supplier] where the plastic type are described as "FA [[The Football Association|(Football Association)]] proffered (<i>preferred?</i>)".
