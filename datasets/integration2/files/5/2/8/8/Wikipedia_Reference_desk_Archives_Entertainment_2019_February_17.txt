== Replacing image trouble ==

I have been wanting to replace the image on the [[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]] article with a clear image from the official Buzzr website that is airing the reruns in a marathon but keep getting the previous image. Is there anything I'm doing wrong with this or is this all I can do. [[User:Pahiy|Pahiy]] ([[User talk:Pahiy|talk]]) 21:57, 17 February 2019 (UTC)
: {{ReplyTo|Pahiy}} I see the Buzzr image in the article.  Try [[WP:PURGE]].  [[User:RudolfRed|RudolfRed]] ([[User talk:RudolfRed|talk]]) 23:26, 17 February 2019 (UTC)
