[[User:Imssnegi|Imssnegi]] ([[User talk:Imssnegi|talk]]) 02:20, 19 February 2019 (UTC)

::{{replyto|Imssnegi}} - as the reviewer said, this draft has nothing in it that indicates the individual is notable (which is not the same as importance). Additionally, it has no references, so there's nothing to support any claim to notability, in any case.

{{Lafc|username=Ngprasad|ts=05:30:50, 19 February 2019|draft=Draft:Chennai_sisters}}


I HAVE PROVIDED COUPLE OF REFERENCES FROM THE MEDIA NEWS ABOUT CHENNAI SISTERS (THE HINDU & RAAGA.COM). STILL MY PAGE IS NOT APPROVED. LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE ON THIS. 

[[User:Ngprasad|Ngprasad]] ([[User talk:Ngprasad|talk]]) 05:30, 19 February 2019 (UTC)

::{{replyto|Ngprasad}} - firstly, please don't use all caps, screaming will encourage reviewers to quickly examine your questions. 

::Secondly, as you're looking to see if the draft should now be approved with the additional sources (as opposed to the original review being wrong) you'll need to resubmit, in a similar fashion to how you uploaded it to AfC the first time. If you have trouble doing this then you can post a new comment below asking for help, or at the [[WP:TEAHOUSE]] or ask me on my talk page.

::However, I would advise against it at the moment. Your Raaga reference is just a track/album listing - it doesn't provide any [[WP:SIG|significant coverage]] on the artists. The Hindu source, while it would normally be well suited, only provides 3 lines on the Chennai sisters, which again, is not sufficient. 

::Your article suggests that they have been on international performances - depending on these came about - frequent trips/one or more big tours as opposed to occasional visits to other countries, it might satisfy notability in that fashion. Have a look for references that talk about their international performances. Preferably sources that discuss multiple performances, though if you can find reviews of several performances that would also do.

I have addressed all of the changes requested for this page. It was requested to only use “Dr” once and subject’s last name thereafter. Also, I converted all links to internal links as requested. Despite these numerous modifications, the entry was rejected. Please assist. I have worked hard to ensure I have addressed all concerns.

[[User:Sebdubois77|Sebdubois77]] ([[User talk:Sebdubois77|talk]]) 08:48, 19 February 2019 (UTC)
:Hi {{U|Sebdubois77}}. I have returned the draft to the reviewing pool because the rejection may have been a technical error.
:Despite your belief that you have addressed all concerns, many problems remain. There are external links in the body, such as Obesity Medicine & Nutrition Fellowship, Day League, American Board of Obesity Medicine, and Delta Airlines. Such links are not allowed. The draft is severely overlinked. Read [[MOS:LINK]] to gain an appreciation of what to link and what not to link.
:The draft cites a large number of sources, and cites each only once. This can be an indication of several problems. It may be that no independent sources have written more than a few sentences about her. It may be that the draft relies too much on primary sources. It may be that the draft includes excessive detail. An encyclopedia summarizes, it doesn't list every publication someone has written for/been quoted in, every award someone has been honored with, or every committee they have co-chaired. The draft should hit the significant points in her life. This ties in with the draft's most serious problem, that the lead fails to tell the reader why she is notable. See [[WP:PROF]] for ways in which an academic can be notable, and decide what sources you need to cite to prove that she meets one or more of the criteria. [[WP:THREE]] may be a useful exercise to help you determine what is important. Then see [[MOS:LEAD]] for how to write the lead. As a final note for now, the citation of sources is sloppy. Some are bare urls, and others omit basic bibliographic information, such as the title of the article and page number on which the information appears. --[[User:Worldbruce|Worldbruce]] ([[User talk:Worldbruce|talk]]) 17:32, 19 February 2019 (UTC)
