==Early life==
Peter Schuyler was born in 1707<ref>{{cite web|title=Pieter Schuyler 1707–1762|url=http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/pieter-schuyler_6439838|website=www.ancestry.com|publisher=New York, Genealogical Records, 1675–1920|accessdate=September 9, 2016}}</ref> in New Barbadoes Neck, opposite [[Belleville, New Jersey]]. He was the son of Swantje Van Duyckhuysen (1679–1724) and [[Arent Schuyler]] (1662–1730) of [[Rensselaerswyck]], now ([[Albany, New York|Albany]]), [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was the grandson of [[Philip Pieterse Schuyler]] (1628–1683) and Margarita Van Slichtenhorst (1627–1710) and the nephew of [[Pieter Schuyler]] (1657–1724), mayor of Albany.<ref name="Library"/>

In 1710, his father purchased a large tract of land along the shores of the [[Passaic River]] where large amounts of copper were discovered and mined at the [[Schuyler Copper Mine]].<ref name="Lienhard"/> When his father died in 1730, he received 787 acres of land and a large home. He also received one-third of the profits from his father's copper mine.<ref name="Krugler"/>

==Career==
In order to pump out mines which would fill with water in his father's copper mine, Schuyler arranged for the first [[steam engine]] in North America to be built.<ref name="Lienhard">{{Cite web|last = Lienhard  | first = John H.  | authorlink =   | title = No 1085 America's First Steam Engine  | work = Engines of our Ingenuity  | date =   | url = http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1085.htm  | doi =   | accessdate = 2010-09-18}}</ref> [[County Route 507 (New Jersey)|Schuyler Avenue]], which runs along the eastern edge of the ridge honors the early settlement.

===Military service===
In 1746, during [[King George's War]], Schuyler, a colonel of militia, raised a detachment of 500 volunteer soldiers to fight in the [[1st New Jersey Regiment|Jersey Blues]].<ref name="Doherty"/> After arriving in Albany in September 1746, the expedition was abandoned and his soldiers complained and threatened to leave. He wrote to the governor in February 1747, asking for a surgeon, medicine, clothing, flints, bread and peas. Governor Hamilton replied in May 1747, complimenting Col. Schuyler for his zeal and offered each man "two speckled shirts and one pair of shoes." As this did little to calm down his men, he paid thousands of his own pounds to still the situation.  Later, Schuyler and his detachment were sent to Saratoga to garrison the fort.<ref name="Library"/><ref name="Lurie">{{cite book|last1=Lurie|first1=Maxine N.|last2=Veit|first2=Richard F.|title=Envisioning New Jersey: An Illustrated History of the Garden State|date=September 16, 2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=9780813569680|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IBIVDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=peter+schuyler+(1710-1762)#v=onepage&q=peter%20schuyler%20(1710-1762)&f=false|accessdate=2 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>
