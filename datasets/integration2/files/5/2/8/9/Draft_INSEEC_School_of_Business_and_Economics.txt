The '''INSEEC School of Business and Economics''' (L'Institut des hautes Etudes Economiques et Commerciales) is a [[Grandes écoles|Grande Ecole]] French Business School, (formerly named: INSEEC Business School until 2019), with French, European and international campuses in Paris, Bordeaux, Lyon, Chambéry, London, Monaco, Geneva and Shanghai as well as San Francisco.

INSEEC Business School is the flagship School of the INSEEC Group: INSEEC U.<sup>[2]</sup>.Europe's largest corporation in Higher Education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://grandes-ecoles.studyrama.com/espace-prepas/reportages-dans-les-ecoles/inseec-business-school/inseec-business-school-les-criteres-booster-3831.html|title=INSEEC Business School, les critères booster|date=2016-04-07|website=Studyrama Grandes Ecoles|language=fr|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> 

Founded in 1975 by José Soubiran in Bordeaux, INSEEC grew gradually by acquiring other Business and Engineering Schools in France and abroad.

INSEEC is a private Business School and not a consular Business School, the latter being founded and directly dependent to a local [[Chamber of commerce|French Chamber of Commerce]].

INSEEC grew at a fast pace, and especially internationally, underpined by [[Career Education Corporation]] until October 24th 2013 [1]. From a local School founded and based in Bordeaux, it has developed tiers with the American Education System via its Franco-American Business School: the MBA Institute - American BBA INSEEC Campus in Paris, which prepares French and International Students for a prestigious MBA in the US, enabling them to obtain at the end a diploma recognised both in Europe and in the USA. Strong bounds have been created with several prestigious American Universities such as: [[Emory University|Emory]] (''Atlanta''), [[Indiana University]] (''Pennsylvania'') or [[San Francisco State University]] allowing students to dive into American Campuses.

It is a member of the [[Conférence des grandes écoles (CGE)]] since 2009, the '''rough equivalent of the [[Ivy League]] in France.'''

A [[Grandes écoles|Grande Ecole]], literally "Great School" is a Higher Education Institution part of '''a French league of elite Universities'''<sup>[3]</sup>, which has been created by [[Napoleon|Napoléon]] in the early Nineteenth century and which core-rule is to select students via national competitive entrance examinations (in French: ''concours'') to safeguard meritocracy and impartiality<sup>[4]</sup>. French National competitive entrance examinations are organised in pools of examinations (''Banque de Concours''). INSEEC belongs to the BCE pool<sup>[5]</sup>.

INSEEC has also been bestowed the following accreditations: [[Union of Independent Grandes Écoles|UGEI]], [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]]<sup>[6]</sup>, [[EFMD]], VISA (''Le visa du ministère de l’Enseignement supérieur et de la Recherche'': Approval of the French Ministry for Higher Education and Research), DD-RS (''Développement durable et responsabilité sociétale'': Sustainability and Societal Responsibility), [[Commission d'évaluation des formations et diplômes de gestion|CEF DG]], and is a member of [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business|AACSB]].

Another specific feature of the [[Grandes écoles|Grande Ecole]] INSEEC Business School, it has the second highest rate in France of ''Admissions Parallèles,'' literary: Parallel Admissions.

Parallel Admissions are French students being admitted in a given [[Grandes écoles|Grande Ecole]] depending on their final score at national selective examination, in the run-up of obtaining their Undergraduate Degree or a bachelor's degree.<sup>[7]</sup> French students who don't stem from the Parallel Admissions régime, are students who passed the national selective examination right after two-years of intensive preparations to the ''Concours.''

Those intensive preparatory classes called in French: [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|''Classes Préparatoires'']], often abbreviated as ''Prépa','' select the best performers who passed their [[Baccalauréat|French A-level]] (called ''[[Baccalauréat]]''). If there are rankings of Engineering and Business [[Grandes écoles|Grande Ecoles]], there are also rankings of Classes Préparatoire too<sup>[8][9][10]</sup>. Those intensive preparatory classes are held by [[Secondary education in France|French high schools]], although they are considered a post-A-level and thus higher education curriculum.
