==History==
In 1985, Michael McLean at [[Audiogenic]], a subsidiary of [[Supersoft]] wrote [[Graham Gooch's Test Cricket]] for the [[Commodore 64|C64]] computer system.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamebase64.com/oldsite/gameofweek/5/gotw_ggtestcricket.htm | title=Review of Graham Gooch's Test Cricket with release details | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> The game sold well and received high ratings, and so [[Audiogenic]] followed it up with [[Graham Gooch's All Star Cricket]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allgame.com/cg/agg.dll?p=agg&sql=1:19759 | title=Release details of Graham Gooch's All Star Cricket on Allgame.com | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> The game that was to become [[Graham Gooch World Class Cricket]] was scheduled to be released for the [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] in 1991, but development was delayed to ensure quality. When it did eventually appear in 1993 it was a huge success,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/grahamgo.htm | title=CU Amiga review of Graham Gooch's World Class Cricket from 1993 | accessdate=2007-03-23 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515075445/http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/grahamgo.htm | archivedate=2007-05-15 }}</ref> reaching No.1 in the [[Amiga]] charts. A PC version followed a year later.

In 1994 Audiogenic identified an opportunity to capitalise on the success of [[Brian Lara]], who had broken two long-standing world records, and rebranded World Class Cricket game as [[Brian Lara Cricket]], initially for the [[DOS]] but also later for the [[Amiga]]. A year later Audiogenic licensed [[Brian Lara Cricket]] for the [[Sega]] [[Mega Drive]] to [[Codemasters]]. It was successful and spent 10 weeks at No.1 in the UK video games chart during the summer of 1995. [[Brian Lara Cricket '96]] was released the following year in 1996 also by [[Codemasters]], and it too got to No.1 in the charts. In late 1996 [[Codemasters]] acquired the [[Audiogenic]] development and [[Brian Lara Cricket '99]] for the [[PlayStation]] console was released in 1998.

In 2005 Codemasters released [[Brian Lara International Cricket 2005]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] console, it was released on 21 July to coincide with the start of the 2005 [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series. The game received high ratings.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/brian-lara-international-cricket-2005/ | title=Mobygames webpage on Brian Lara International Cricket 2005 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> Off the back of this success, Codemasters has developed [[Brian Lara International Cricket 2007]] which was released in March, 2007, to coincide with the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Brian Lara Pressure Play]] followed in August for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]],<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.codemasters.co.uk/press/?showarticle=10713 | title=Brian Lara 2007 Pressure Play smashes into shops today | publisher=[[Codemasters]] | date=2007-08-31 | accessdate=2007-11-06 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> reaching No.1 in its first week on release.<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.codemasters.co.uk/press/?showarticle=10796 | title=Brian Lara 2007 Pressure Play Hits Number One in the Charts | date=2007-09-07 | accessdate=2007-11-06 | publisher=[[Codemasters]] | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111050338/http://www.codemasters.co.uk/press/?showarticle=10796 | archive-date=2007-11-11 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

With Brian Lara's retirement from professional cricket in 2007 Codemasters moved away from using Lara in the title. The next cricket game released by the publisher was [[Ashes Cricket 2009]] in August 2009, which continues with the same playing style as the Brian Lara series of cricket games.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1010860p1.html | title=Ashes Cricket 2009 UK Review | date=2009-08-05 | accessdate=2010-08-01 | author=Robinson, Martin | publisher=[[IGN UK]]}}</ref> [[Codemasters]] has released the latest [[International Cricket 2010]] on June 18, 2010 as a sequel to the [[Ashes Cricket 2009]]. The Cricket series is moving on after Brian Lara's retirement and re-branding of the video games series.
