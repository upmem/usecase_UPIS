==Plot==
Tim is a used car salesman who uses profanity and antagonizes people into purchasing his cars. After making a deal with the devil, Tim finds himself with only an hour to sell a car, but his plan to do so spins out of control when he murders the wife of a customer, who swears revenge.

==Production==
Based on his popular ''Cars'' sketches, Bobby Hacker filmed ''Cars 3'' during the span of one month in 2008.<ref name=Portland>{{cite web|last=Ferguson|first=Courtney|title=Cars III on DVD: Get Out Your Fuckin' Checkbook!|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/BlogtownPDX/archives/2013/05/23/cars-iii-on-dvd-get-out-your-fuckin-checkbook|publisher=[[The Portland Mercury]]|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Hacker shot ''Cars 3'' quickly, so he could enter it in the [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=stranger/>

The film's dialogue and plot were improvised by the actors.<ref name=stranger>{{cite web|last=Regan|first=Kyle|title=Yesterday The Stranger Suggested: Cars 3|url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2010/01/26/yesterday-the-stranger-suggested-cars-3-at-annex-theatre|publisher=[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> Unlike the ''Cars'' shorts, which run for roughly two minutes,<ref name=stranger/> ''Cars 3'' has a running time of 38 minutes.

==Reception==
Patrick Bromley, writing for ''[[DVD Verdict]],'' said while there was an audience for Hacker's brand of humor, he found it to be overly loud and obnoxious, and compared it to ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' "minus the cleverness and satire."<ref name=DVDV/> Kyle Regan, writing for ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]], wrote that "Cars 3 never aims for subtlety, not that it necessarily needs it. But in a movie far longer than the average internet video sensation, the ADD-riddled plot turns, jokes, and gags dragged."<ref name=stranger/>

Courtney Ferguson, writing for ''[[The Portland Mercury]],'' said, "I wasn't sorry Cars III was so stupid. I loved how stupid Cars III was. Itâ€™s a glorious melange of yelling, nunchucks, lasers, gunfights, dead burned lesbians, and blood-spurting belly buttons."<ref name=Portland/>

==Release==
The day after shooting finished, ''Cars 3'' premiered at the New Beverly Theater. The premiere was hosted by comedian [[Patton Oswalt]].<ref name=DVDV/><ref>{{cite web|last=Jardine|first=Jessica|title=Interview: Patton Oswalt|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/patton-oswalt,14311/|publisher=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref> It was later released on DVD in 2009 by [[Troma Entertainment]]. Special features include the other films in the ''Cars'' series and trailers for other Troma films.<ref name=DVDV/>
