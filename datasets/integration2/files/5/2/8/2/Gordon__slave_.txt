'''Gordon''', or "'''Whipped Peter'''" ([[floruit|fl.]] 1863), was an [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved]] African American who escaped from a Louisiana [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in March 1863, gaining freedom when he reached the [[Union Army|Union]] camp near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. He became known as the subject of photographs documenting the extensive [[keloid]] scarring of his back from whippings received in slavery. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionists]] distributed these [[carte de visite]] photographs of Gordon throughout the United States and internationally to show the abuses of slavery.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Scourged Slave's Back|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/917225/the_scourged_slaves_back/?|accessdate=August 25, 2014|work=The Liberator|date=September 4, 1863|location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref>

==Escape==
Gordon escaped in March 1863 from the {{convert|3000|acre|km2|0|adj=on}} plantation of John and Bridget Lyons, who held him and nearly 40 other people in slavery at the time of the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]].<ref name="Polemical Pain" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Population schedules of the eighth census of the United States, 1860, Louisiana|url=https://archive.org/stream/populationschedu431unit#page/n287/mode/1up|accessdate=January 4, 2015|volume=Reel 431 – St. Landry Parish|oclc=22655687|year=1965|origyear=1860|page=111|publisher=Washington : National Archives and Records Service, General Services Administration}}</ref> The Lyons plantation was located along the west bank of the [[Atchafalaya River]] in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry Parish]], between present-day [[Melville, Louisiana|Melville]] and [[Krotz Springs, Louisiana]].<ref name="Shaw">{{cite web|last1=Lyons Shaw|first1=Adonica|title=Captain John Lyons of St. Landry Parish|url=http://shawra.com/gen/index_files/Page1884.htm|publisher=Lyons Family website|date=n.d.|access-date=July 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082724/http://shawra.com/gen/index_files/Page1884.htm|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

To mask his scent from the [[bloodhound]]s that were chasing him, Gordon took onions from his plantation, which he carried in his pockets. After crossing each creek or swamp, he rubbed his body with the onions to throw the dogs off his scent.

During the examination, Gordon is quoted as saying,

<blockquote>Ten days from to-day I left the plantation. Overseer Artayou Carrier whipped me. I was two months in bed sore from the whipping. My master come after I was whipped; he discharged the overseer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Scars of slavery|url=http://docsteach.org/documents/533232/detail|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=August 26, 2013}}</ref> My master was not present. I don't remember the whipping.  I was two months in bed sore from the whipping and my sense began to come—I was sort of crazy.  I tried to shoot everybody.  They said so, I did not know.  I did not know that I had attempted to shoot everyone; they told me so.  I burned up all my clothes; but I don't remember that.  I never was this way (crazy) before.  I don't know what make me come that way (crazy).  My master come after I was whipped; saw me in bed; he discharged the overseer.  They told me I attempted to shoot my wife the first one; I did not shoot any one; I did not harm any one.  My master's Capt.

==Service in Union Army==
Gordon joined the [[Union Army]] as a guide three months after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] allowed for the enrollment of [[freedman|freed slave]]s into the military forces. On one expedition, he was taken prisoner by the [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]]; they tied him up, beat him, and left him for dead. He survived and once more escaped to Union lines.<ref name="Harper's Weekly" />

Gordon soon afterwards enlisted in a [[United States Colored Troops|U.S. Colored Troops]] Civil War unit. He was said{{By whom|date=December 2019}} to have fought bravely as a [[sergeant#United States|sergeant]] in the ''[[United States Colored Troops#Corps d.27Afrique|Corps d'Afrique]]'' during the [[Siege of Port Hudson]] in May 1863.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Picture for the Times|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1164673/sergeant_gordon_of_the_second_louisiana/?|accessdate=October 16, 2014|work=The Liberator|date=July 3, 1863|location=Boston|page=3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref> It was the first time that African-American soldiers played a leading role in an assault.<ref name="Shumard" />

"I have found a large number of the four hundred [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] examined by me to be badly lacerated as the specimen represented in the enclosed photograph." —J.W.

|quote   = There has lately come to us, from Baton Rouge, the photograph of a former slave—now, thanks to the Union army, a freeman.  It represents him in a sitting posture, his stalwart body bared to the waist, his fine head and intelligent face in profile, his left arm bent, resting upon his hip, and his naked back exposed to full view.  Upon that back, horrible to contemplate! is a testimony against slavery more eloquent than any words.  Scarred, gouged, gathered in great ridges, knotted, furrowed, the poor tortured flesh stands out a hideous record of the slave-driver's lash.  Months have elapsed since the martyrdom was undergone, and the wounds have healed, but as long as the flesh lasts will this fearful impress remain.  It is a touching picture, an appeal so mute and powerful that none but hardened natures can look upon it unmoved.  However much men may depict false images, the sun will not lie.  From such evidence as this there is no escape, and to see is to believe.  Many, therefore, desired a copy of the photograph, and from the original numerous copies have been taken.

The surgeon of the [[1st Louisiana Native Guard (United States)|First Louisiana regiment, (colored,)]] writing to his brother in the city, encloses this photograph, with these words: 

<blockquote>I send you the picture of a slave as he appears after a whipping.  I have seen, during the period I have been inspecting men for my own and other regiments, ''hundreds of such sights''—so they are not new to me; but it may be new to you.  If you know of any one who talks about the ''humane manner'' in which the slaves are treated, please show them this picture.  It is a lecture in itself.</blockquote>{{cite news|title= —Picture of a Slave|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/824572/the_liberator/?|work=[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]|date=12 June 1863|location=Boston, Massachusetts|page=2}}}}

{{quote box |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |width = 75% |align=center
|quote  = We received from Baton Rouge the photographic likeness of a slave's naked back, lacerated by the whip ...  We look on the picture with amazement that cannot find words for utterance.  Amazement at the cruelty which could perpetrate such an outrage as this; at the brutal folly, the stupid ignorance, that could permit such a piece of infatuation; at the absence not only of humane feeling, but of economical prudence of common sense, of ordinary intelligence, displayed in such frantic thoughtlessness.  Among what sort of people are such things possible? ... This card-photograph should be multiplied by the hundred thousand, and scattered over the states.  It tells the story in a way that even [[Harriet Beecher Stowe|Mrs. Stowe]] cannot approach; because it tells the story to the eye.  If seeing is believing—and it is in the immense majority of cases—seeing this card would be equivalent to believing things of the slave states which Northern men and women would move heaven and earth to abolish!
