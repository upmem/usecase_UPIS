A true-color image of '''[[Io (moon)|Io]]''', one of the moons of [[Jupiter]], taken by the ''[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]'' spacecraft. The dark spot just left of the center is the erupting volcano [[Prometheus (volcano)|Prometheus]]. The whitish plains on either side of it are coated with volcanically deposited [[sulfur dioxide]] frost, whereas the yellower regions contain a higher proportion of [[sulfur]].
