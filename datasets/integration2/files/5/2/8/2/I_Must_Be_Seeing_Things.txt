'''''I Must Be Seeing Things''''' the 12th album released by American singer [[Gene Pitney]], released on the [[Musicor Records|Musicor]] label in the [[United States]] in 1965. The album was released as '''''Looking Through the Eyes of Love''''' on the [[Stateside Records|Stateside]] label in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Background==

At the time of this album's release, Musicor Records was in the middle of a distribution transformation. Art Talmadge, an employee of Musicor's parent United Artists Records, had recently bought the label from UA and ran it (along with fellow UA employee Harold "Pappy" Daily) under his newly created Talmadge Productions company.  Although all album covers bear the Talmadge Productions name, labels of first pressings still included the United Artists disclaimer at the bottom. Once Musicor's transformation from UA to Talmadge was completed, the disclaimer was changed on the label (which also underwent some other cosmetic changes) and the ''I Must Be Seeing Things'' album continued circulation.
 
Original copies with UA disclaimer feature "Looking Thru (sic) The Eyes Of Love" on side 2, track 6.  This was replaced on the new Talmadge labeled copies with "If I Never Get To Love You". 
 

The title track was a top 10 hit in Canada and the UK but only reached #31 in the US.<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/302676/gene-pitney/chart|title=Billboard charts - Gene Pitney|access-date=April 9, 2017}}</ref> The UK release of the album featured "[[Looking Through the Eyes of Love]]", a top 10 hit in the UK as well as Canada.
