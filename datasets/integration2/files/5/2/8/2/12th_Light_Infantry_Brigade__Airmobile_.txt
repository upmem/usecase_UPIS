On June 18, 1919, the 4th Infantry Brigade was created, based in the city of São Paulo, and after successive transformations, gave rise to the current Light Brigade. In September 1919 the Brigade was transferred to Cacapava, having been temporarily extinguished in November 1930. In October 1932 Command of the 4th Inf Brigade was reactivated in May and 1934 becomes organic 2nd Infantry Division.
    
In 1938 it was opened the Command Infantry divisional (ID / 2), replacing the 4th Inf Brigade, which is extinct. Remains under that name until 1971, when a change occurs to the 12th Infantry Brigade and becomes part of the 2nd Army Division.
    
Fifteen years later had his name changed again, and began to form in the 12th Motorized Infantry Brigade, finally, by Ministerial Reserved No. 023, of June 19, 1995, was transformed in the 12th Light Infantry Brigade (Airmobile), maintaining its headquarters in Cacapava.
