{{short description|Degree offered by University College London}}
The '''UCL Arts & Sciences degree''' is an [[interdisciplinary]], [[undergraduate]] degree at [[University College London]], United Kingdom. It is part of the [[UCL Faculty of Arts and Humanities]] for administrative purposes, but it engages fully with all science, social science and humanities faculties across UCL. The degree offers a bespoke programme incorporating both arts and sciences (including social sciences) specialisms with students graduating with a Bachelors in Arts & Sciences (abbreviated "BASc").<ref name="UCL Arts & Sciences website">{{cite web|title=Prospective Students|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/prospective|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> The programme offers material from almost all UCL departments, including new modules specifically designed for the course by leading UCL academics.<ref name="myScience UK website">{{cite web|title=UCL launches innovative new Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree|url=http://www.myscience.org.uk/wire/ucl_launches_innovative_new_arts_and_sciences_undergraduate_degree-2011-UCL|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>

== History ==
The first intake began in September 2012 with 87 students.
The intake is now 120 per year and there are 400-450 students on the course in total, including international affiliate students.

== Degree ==
The course offers a choice of both a major and minor pathway from the outset with half of the degree devoted to the pathways: Cultures, Health and Environment, Sciences and Engineering, and Societies. Students are required to study a mix of arts and sciences throughout the degree programme and are also offered the opportunity to study abroad for a year. Half of their programme consists of core courses, including modules on quantitative methods, research projects, philosophy of knowledge, qualitative thinking and a language.<ref name="New York Times article">{{cite news|last=Guttenplan|first=D.D.|title=In Britain, a Return to the Idea of the Liberal Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/world/europe/in-britain-a-return-to-the-idea-of-the-liberal-arts.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2&|accessdate=24 August 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Times Higher Education">{{cite web|last=Worton|first=Michael|title=Big picture from all angles|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/comment/opinion/big-picture-from-all-angles/2001745.article|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>

==Staff==

=== Programme director ===
[[Carl Gombrich]], ex-Programme Director, was the Principal of UCL's [[UCL University Preparatory Certificate (UPC)|international preparatory certificates]] before being appointed Programme Director, Arts and Sciences (BASc) in September 2010, a role he held until March 2019. He has degrees in mathematics, physics and philosophy and was also an opera singer before joining UCL in 2002. He is currently learning [[Mandarin Chinese]]. He is the grandson of [[Ernst Gombrich]], the art historian whose work he cites as the inspiration for his efforts to reach across disciplines.<ref name="New York Times article" /><ref name="UCL Arts & Sciences People">{{cite web|title=UCL Arts & Science People|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/basc/people|publisher=UCL|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>

== Value of the course ==
[[Malcolm Grant]], UCL Provost until 2013, when talking about UCL Arts and Sciences in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' said that, “I've always felt it was a mistake to make students specialize at such a young age. At 15, how many people know they want to be scientists — or lawyers?”. He explains that, “This program combines the best of the British model, where you progress from year to year, with the fairly significant amount of choice you have in America.” He concludes, “If we can continue to attract the smartest students, as we have done in the first year, I think this will become the principal mode of entry into this university.”<ref name="New York Times article" />

=== Liberal arts degrees ===
UCL Arts & Sciences is similar to some liberal arts degrees which also encompass studies in mathematics, science, arts, and languages. There is a growing movement in Europe for a [[liberal arts education]] with nearly a dozen being established within the UK in the past couple of years.<ref name="Liberal Arts in the UK">{{cite web|url=http://www.libartslondon.co.uk/8299/liberal-arts-uk/|title=Liberal Arts in the UK|publisher=London School of Liberal Arts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826010425/http://www.libartslondon.co.uk/8299/liberal-arts-uk/|archive-date=3 April 2017|url-status=dead|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> There are now also many more UK liberal arts degrees for example in the universities of [[University of Exeter|Exeter]], [[University of Winchester|Winchester]], [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Kent|Kent]], and [[King's College London]].<ref name="LA Times Article">{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Aaron|title=College: It's not just 'Made in the U.S.A.'|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rosen-americans-foreign-colleges-20130820,0,7321491.story?facebook|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>

Touting the benefits of liberal arts education, David Oxtoby, president of [[Pomona College]] in California said "Narrow training that prepares you for one particular career just doesn't work any more". He believes a liberal arts degree is also good for society. "The broader benefit is preparing educated citizens, people who will take an active part in society, who will be intelligent voters, who can read a newspaper, understand the issues and be part of an educated electorate.".<ref name="Breadth that Matters">{{cite web|last=Attwood|first=Rebecca|title=It's the breadth that matters|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/414650.article|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=25 August 2013}}</ref>
