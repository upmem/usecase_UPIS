This is a minor, fan-developed game that is unlikely to have garnered attention or reviews from any quality sources. [[User:TTN|TTN]] ([[User talk:TTN|talk]]) 00:32, 25 August 2013 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. If anyone can point to quality sources in Japanese I'm willing to revert my opinion. The problem here is that this looks like it has never gained any true coverage in reliable sources as far as I can tell. I did a search in English and a search using the Japanese on the entry and Google Translate, but neither brought up anything that would show that this article should be kept. I'm aware that GT has some serious flaws, but this seems to have been a fairly underground game as far as I can tell. Sometimes these sort of games gain a substantial following and become wildly popular ([[Higurashi When They Cry|Higurashi]] is a great example of this), but this just isn't the case here, at least not yet.
