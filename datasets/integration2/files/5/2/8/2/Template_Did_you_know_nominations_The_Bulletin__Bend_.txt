*... that the original office for '''[[The Bulletin (Bend)|''The Bulletin'']]''', the first newspaper in [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]], [[Oregon]], was in a rustic cabin located on the banks of the [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]]?
:* ''Reviewed'': [[Template:Did you know nominations/Clarence Chesterfield Howerton|Clarence Chesterfield Howerton]]
:* ''Comment'': Hook source is from [http://www.orenews.com/web/members/op/OPAugust2003.pdf Ref 3] (top of p. 6) and Ref 1 (''East of the Cascades'' by Phil Brogan, pp. 213-214; unfortunately, that source is not available on-line)
<small>Created/expanded by [[User:Orygun|Orygun]] ([[User talk:Orygun|talk]]), [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] ([[User talk:Valfontis|talk]]).&nbsp;Nominated by [[User:Orygun|Orygun]] ([[User talk:Orygun|talk]]) at 23:54, 24 August 2013 (UTC)</small>.

:* [[File:Symbol confirmed.svg|16px]] This article is a five-fold expansion and is new enough and long enough. I added extra citations to the sentence backing up the hook. Although [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] has been credited for taking part in the expansion, I see no mention of this in the article history.

::* You are correct, [[User:Valfontis|Valfontis]] was not involved in the expansion; however, that was editor who first created article.  If including original editor isn't necessary, single editor credit is fine.  Hopefully, this this won't hold up DYK release.--[[User:Orygun|Orygun]] ([[User talk:Orygun|talk]]) 21:13, 1 September 2013 (UTC){{#if:yes|</div></noinclude>|{{#ifeq:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|Template talk:Did you know/{{SUBPAGENAME}}|[[Category:Pending DYK nominations]][[Category:DYK/Nominations|Pending]]|{{#ifeq:{{FULLPAGENAME}}|Template:Did you know nominations/{{SUBPAGENAME}}|[[Category:DYK/Nominations|Pending]][[Category:Pending DYK nominations]]}}}}}}<!--Please do not write below this line or remove this line.
