===''My Life as a Ghost''===

As a 14-year-old, Borsook suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) after being shot in the head. In 2013, after attending a meeting of people with TBI, Borsook realized that some others with TBI had the same experiences of disconnection she had always felt, a "ghostly" feeling that "[s]omething gets dislocated in the sense of knowing that you belong to yourself and your life". From this epiphany, she conceived the project “[http://mylifeasaghost.org/ My Life as a Ghost],” an [[art installation]] that combines video, audio, performance, and other media into a [[built environment]] to explore "[w]hat happens when the soul is blasted out of the body and is incompletely returned".<ref>{{cite news|last=Dakkak |first=Angelique|title=Paulina Borsook shares thoughts on her "My Life as a Ghost" project|url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/11/11/paulina-borsook-shares-thoughts-on-her-my-life-as-a-ghost-project/|magazine=The Stanford Daily|date=November 11, 2013}}</ref>

She became the first artist in the [[Stanford University|Stanford Arts Institute’s]] new Research Residency program, and presented the concept to an audience in October 2013 at Stanford University's Bing Theatre.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eichelberger|first=Eric|title=Paulina Borsook: My Life as a Ghost|url=http://artsinstitute.stanford.edu/paulina-borsook-my-life-as-a-ghost|publisher= The Stanford Arts Institute|date=October 31, 2013}}</ref>
