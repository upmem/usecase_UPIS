==Geography and geology==
[[File:North Mountain from the south.JPG|thumb|left|North Mountain as seen from [[Jordan Township, Lycoming County, Pennsylvania|Jordan Township, Lycoming County]]]]
North Mountain extends over portions of three counties.<ref name = "ghost"/> However, its highest point is in Sullivan County.<ref name = "peakbagger"/> The mountain is part of the [[Endless Mountains]], although it is slightly removed from the main body of these mountains. It is also on the eastern edge of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. A 1920 book called the mountain the "monarch of hills". The same book also stated that it resembled [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]].<ref name = "mementos"/> The [[Loyalsock Creek|Loyalsock Valley]] is close to North Mountain.<ref name = "south mountain"/> The mountain has an area of approximately 250 square miles.

The North Mountain plateau has [[anticline|anticlinal]] and [[syncline|synclinal]] axes that run north 75° east to south 75° west. There is also a nearby geological structure known as the Ganoga Basin, which runs between Spring Creek and North Mountain. The rock of the basin gently slopes northwards and southwards.<ref name = "the geology"/> At one point, the mountain rises {{convert|1200|ft|m}} above the surrounding area. At that point, the horizontal distance is from the surrounding area to the peak is {{convert|2640|ft|m}}, giving the mountain a [[slope]] of approximately 0.46.<ref>{{Citation|author = Craig A.

==History==
The area around North Mountain was originally controlled by the [[Seneca people|Senecas]]. However, the last [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] village in the vicinity of North Mountain was destroyed in 1784 by a group of rangers led by Nigel Gray, Colonel of the Rangers. They also captured and wounded [[Skanando]], a [[scalping|scalp hunter]] of the region.<ref name = "mementos">{{Citation|author = Henry Wharton Shoemaker|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zyAwAAAAYAAJ&q=%22North+Mountain%22|title = North Mountain Mementos: Legends and Traditions Gathered in Northern Pennsylvania|year = 1920|accessdate = August 25, 2013}}</ref> A trail blazed to facilitate communication between the frontier of upper Fishing Creek and North Mountain and forts on the Susquehanna River once lead from the community of [[Buckhorn, Pennsylvania|Buckhorn]] to North Mountain. A tract of land purchased by William Hess by 1792 included parts of the mountain.<ref name = "annals"/><ref name = "battle">{{Citation|author = J.H. Battle (editor)|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CMwwAQAAMAAJ&q=%22North+Mountain%22|title = History of Columbia and Montour Counties, Pennsylvania|year = 1887|accessdate = August 28, 2013}}</ref> However, the first person to settle in the Sullivan County portion of North Mountain was Griffith Phillips, who settled there in 1812.<ref name = "sullivan"/>

The Northumberland Road was built by settlers living near North Mountain in 1806 and 1808. It most likely ran from North Mountain into [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia County]], which was part of [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland County]] at the time. However, it may have run as far north as [[Shrewsbury Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania|Shrewsbury Township]].<ref name = "sullivan"/>

North Mountain was [[surveying|surveyed]] by [[Jonathan Hastie]].<ref name = "south mountain">{{Citation|author = Henry Wharton Shoemaker|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQMAAAAYAAJ&q=%22North+Mountain%22|title = South Mountain sketches: folk tales and legends collected in the mountains of southern Pennsylvania |year = 1920|accessdate = August 28, 2013}}</ref>

During the events of the [[Fishing Creek Confederacy]], there were rumors that a [[fort]] with [[cannon]]s had been built on North Mountain by deserters and draft evaders.<ref>{{citation|author = Robert Sandow|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=i4rLUqXvM-MC&q=fishing+creek+conspiracy&pg=PA122|title= Deserter Country: Civil War Opposition in the Pennsylvania Appalachians|year = 2009|isbn = 9780823230532|accessdate = August 29, 2013}}</ref> 1000 Union soldiers searched for the fort on the mountain in late August 1864, but were unable to find it. However, in 2007, a {{convert|20|ft|m}} cabin used by hiding draft evaders during the American Civil War was discovered on North Mountain.<ref>{{Citation|author = Richard A. Sauers and Peter Tomasak|title = The Fishing Creek Confederacy: A Story of Civil War Draft Resistance|year = 2012}}</ref> However, at the time of the Fishing Creek Confederacy, locals in [[Benton Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Benton Township]], [[Fishing Creek Township, Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Fishing Creek Township]] and neighboring communities did commonly discuss the idea that a fort on the mountain would enable an army of 100 men to defeat an army of 1000 men.<ref name = "battle"/>

==Industries==
Between 1890 and 1910, North Mountain was the location of the last major [[lumbering]] industry in its region. Several communities in the vicinity of the mountain had this as their main industry. From 1887 to 1912, the community of Alderston was a lumbering town; as was [[Harveys Lake, Pennsylvania|Harvey's Lake]] and [[Stull, Pennsylvania|Stull]], from  1891 to 1906. Lopez was a lumbering town from 1887 to 1905, [[Jamison City, Pennsylvania|Jamison City]] was a lumbering town from 1889 to 1912, and [[Ricketts, Pennsylvania|Ricketts]] was a lumbering town from 1890 to 1912. The Lehigh Valley Railroad purchased 13,000 acres of forest on the mountain in 1876.<ref name = "ghost"/>

[[Ice cutting]] was another industry that was practiced in the vicinity of North Mountain. The community of [[Mountain Springs, Pennsylvania|Mountain Springs]] was where the industry was mostly practiced on the mountain. It was done here from 1891 to 1948. It was also practiced near [[Lake Ganoga]] between 1896 and 1915.<ref name = "ghost"/>

[[Arthur Lewis Stull]] was a prominent figure in both the lumbering and the ice cutting industries on the mountain. In the late 1880s, [[R. Bruce Ricketts]] owned portions of the forests on North Mountain.<ref name = "ghost"/>

There were no [[railroad]]s through the area of North Mountain until 1893, when a rail line between [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]] and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania|Towanda]] opened, passing by the mountain. However, the prospect of a railroad past the mountain was considered by the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]], the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and possibly the [[Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad]], although no action was taken at the time. The [[Wilkes-Barre and Harvey’s Lake Railroad]] was later created as another link between R. Bruce Ricketts' land on the mountain and Wilkes-Barre. Later, a large number of spur lines were created in the forests on North Mountain.<ref name = "ghost"/>

==Recreation==
In the 1880s, people from [[Philadelphia]] and other cities would regularly come to the North Mountain area to hunt [[Game (food)|game]], especially [[grouse]] and [[bear]]s, although [[overhunting]] greatly reduced the amount of game in the area. In that time, the mountain was the most prolific spot for game in Pennsylvania, except for the Seven Mountains in [[Centre County, Pennsylvania|Centre County]] and [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania|Mifflin County]].<ref name = "mementos"/>

In 1893, R. Bruce Ricketts finished constructing a [[resort|retreat]] on North Mountain. Work on the retreat was initiated in 1889. In 1879, the North Mountain Fishing Club was founded, and it continued until 1903. It was reestablished in 1907.<ref name = "ghost"/> R. Bruce Ricketts lived at one point in a stone [[mansion]] known as the [[Ganoga House]], which was situated in the vicinity of the mountain. When Ricketts lived in it, it was the highest [[Human habitat|inhabited]] point in Pennsylvania.<ref name = "mementos"/>

There are no major [[ski resort]]s on North Mountain. Much of the land on the mountain is part of the [[Pennsylvania State Game Lands]], particularly State Game Lands Number 13.<ref name = "c63"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com |title=Google Maps |publisher=Google Maps |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> However, between 1964 and 1984, a ski slope did exist on North Mountain near [[Sonestown, Pennsylvania|Sonestown]]. The slope featured a [[J-bar lift]]. A [[Poma lift]] was also brought to the slope, but never installed. There were plans at one point to extend the ski slope to a height 1400 vertical feet, but these plans ran afoul of local [[zoning laws]]. As of 2008, the slope was well-maintained.<ref>{{Citation|author = M. Scott Smith|url = http://www.dcski.com/lostareas/viewlostprofile.php?id=66|title = North Mountain|year = 2011|accessdate = August 29, 2013}}</ref>

==Fauna and flora==
A 1930 report noted that North Mountain was home to [[pine mouse|pine mice]], [[Hoy's shrew]]s, [[southern flying squirrel]]s, and three species of [[bat]]s. The report also stated that [[pika]]s (rock rabbits) from the [[Rocky Mountains]] adapt well the life on North Mountain.<ref>{{Citation|author = Morris Miller Green|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kj_uAAAAMAAJ&q=%22North+Mountain%22+pennsylvania|title = A contribution to the mammalogy of the North mountain region of Pennsylvania|year = 1930|accessdate = August 25, 2013}}</ref> [[Wolf|wolves]] were common in the North Mountain region in 1861, but four years later, in 1865, they were extremely rare in that region. These wolves were typically large gray wolves, with adult males weighing close to {{convert|100|lb|kg}}. As of 1920, the mountain was one of the few places in Pennsylvania where [[American marten|pine martens]] lived, although they were common there before 1900. The area of North Mountain was one of the last areas where northern [[white-tailed deer]] survived in significant numbers. Also, more white deer have been killed in the vicinity of North Mountain than in anywhere else in Pennsylvania, as of 1920.<ref name = "mementos"/> In the early 1800s, the mountain was said to be home to every mammal and bird species in Pennsylvania.<ref name = "mementos"/> The bird population of the mountain was studied as early as 1891.<ref name = "c63"/>

There was a high concentration of [[beech]] mast in the area of North Mountain as of 1920. [[Pine]] and [[Tsuga|hemlock]] have also been observed on the mountain.<ref name = "mementos"/> Originally, there were mature and [[Old-growth forest|primeval]] forests, but after the lumbering industry, they were largely replaced by northern [[hardwood]] trees, such as [[sugar maple]], [[red maple]], [[American beech]], and [[black cherry]].<ref name = "c63"/>
