*... that John Irwin, one of the founders of '''[[Clarke, Irwin & Company]]''', a Toronto book publisher, left the company in 1943, only to have his son purchase it more than forty years later?

:* [[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] The article is new and long enough; the hook is under 200 characters and interesting. The article says "It was purchased by former partner John Irwin's Book Society of Canada, now run by John's son." This sounds to me as if the company made the purchase, not necessarily John's son. Could the wording be tweaked? Perhaps "only to have his son's company purchase it ..."? Also, the ALT below trims 3 characters: [[User:Sasata|Sasata]] ([[User talk:Sasata|talk]]) 10:36, 29 August 2013 (UTC)
::'''ALT1''': ... that John Irwin, one of the founders of Toronto book publisher '''[[Clarke, Irwin & Company]]''', left the company in 1943, only to have it purchased more than forty years later by a company run by his son?
:::Sasata, I've just picked up a new source for this, and I'm going to do a bit more work over the weekend.  Might be able to find a juicier hook.  And clarification of the sale to the Book Society of Canada. <span style="text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD">[[User:The Interior|<font color="brown">The</font><font color="green"> Interior</font>]] [[User Talk:The Interior|(Talk)]]</span> 06:02, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
::::[[User:Sasata|Sasata]], sorry I've been away from this for so long.  I agree that adding "company" is more accurate.  I didn't find much more in the hook department after reading the Macskimming book (which is a great read, btw). <span style="text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD">[[User:The Interior|<font color="brown">The</font><font color="green"> Interior</font>]] [[User Talk:The Interior|(Talk)]]</span> 01:33, 14 September 2013 (UTC)

::::::Ok, I've tweaked the ALT1 again (in retrospect, "his son's company" doesn't seem correct â€“ he only worked there). It's still under 200 characters (barely - any trimming possible?), and is more accurate (I think). Do you agree? [[User:Sasata|Sasata]] ([[User talk:Sasata|talk]]) 06:34, 17 September 2013 (UTC)
:::::::Yeah, that works.  I'm fairly sure that the Irwin family were the owners of the Book Society at the time of sale, but MacSkimming isn't explicit about that. <span style="text-shadow: 0.2em 0.2em 0.1em #DDDDDD">[[User:The Interior|<font color="brown">The</font><font color="green"> Interior</font>]] [[User Talk:The Interior|(Talk)]]</span> 21:29, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
