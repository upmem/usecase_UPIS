== Early life ==
Ade Bantu was born in [[Wembley]], London. He is [[multiracial|biracial]], being the son of a German mother and a Nigerian father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.rockpaperscissors.biz/index.cfm/fuseaction/current.articles_detail/project_id/224/article_id/4975.cfm|title=Rock Paper Scissors - Bantu feat. Ayuba, Fuji Satisfaction (Piranha Musik) - Interview with Bantu|website=Archive.rockpaperscissors.biz|access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref> In 1973, he relocated to [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]] with his parents Barbara Odukoya and Adeleke Odukoya. After the death of his father in 1986, he moved with his mother and 3 siblings to Germany. He is the elder brother of musician [[Abiodun (musician)|Abiodun]].

== Musical career ==
Attracted by Germany's emerging [[hiphop]] movement Ade Bantu joined the Hiphop group Exponential Enjoyment with Goldlover D (Sini Demir), Double A ([[Mola Adebisi]]) and General GG (Götz Gottschalk) in 1989. He used the alias and stage name "Duke T".

Their single "Think for a Moment/Style Introduction"(Tan Tric 12") is the 3rd German hiphop release (1989). They went on to produce the first multilingual Hiphop album in Germany titled "Chop or Quench" (1993). It featured the pioneer [[German hiphop]] crew [[Advanced Chemistry]]. This was followed by a [[Free jazz|Free Jazz]] Hiphop album in 1993 with [[Peter Kowald]], [[Sainkho Namtchylak]] and [[Peter Brötzmann]] titled "Expo's Jazz & Joy".

In 1993 he was approached by Fonk Free aka Moreno (Oliver Freyman) and DJ An-dré (André Schröter) and together they founded the band "Weep Not Child' releasing "From Hoyerswerda to Rostock" (Buback Records, 1993) and "Liberation thru Music & Lyrics" (Groove Attack, 1994).
Their music clip "Je Ka Bere" was featured in the European campaign of Media Against Racism.

In 1996 Ade was invited by Jan Ü Krauthaeuser to contribute to the [[Cologne Carnival]] music compilation "Humba 2". This led to the formation of the band [[Bantu (band)|BANTU]] with his brother [[Abiodun (musician)|Abiodun]] aka Don Abi, [[Patrice Bart-Williams|Patrice]] and Amechi (Amechinna Okerenkwo). He officially changed his stage name to Ade (later to Ade Bantu after BANTU's 2005 album release). BANTU's debut album "Fufu" became an instant success in Nigeria earning them two radio hit singles "Nzobu" & "Fire Inna Dancehall". In 2000 after a wave of racist motivated violent attacks on foreigners which climaxed in the killing of [[Alberto Adriano]], Adé Bantu set up the Afro-German musical collective [[Brothers Keepers]]. Their song "Adriano (die letzte Warnung)" (Adriano the final warning) was released in 2001. It became an anti racism anthem selling well over 220,000 copies and making it to the Top 5 of the German pop charts. An album titled "Lightkultur" was released as well as a Sisters Keepers single "Liebe und Verstand" (Love & Understanding).

In 2003 Ade Bantu, his brother Abiodun and German reggae singer [[Gentleman (musician)|Gentleman]] recorded the single "Rudie (Hold It Down)" together with [[UB40]]. In 2004 he released his group BANTU's much anticipated European debut album "Bantu". The album featured Don Abi, [[Sly Dunbar]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Pee Froiss]] from Senegal.

In 2005 Ade Bantu once again assembled Brothers Keepers for a second musical venture. Broadened by many Turkish, Italian, Swedish and German artists their album "Am I My Brothers Keeper?" went far beyond the success of its predecessor, directing rousing statements, biographical insights and critical irony at German society. With BANTU he released "Fuji Satisfaction" an eclectic mix of [[Fuji music|Fuji]], hiphop, [[Dancehall]], [[Afrofunk]] and [[Afrobeat]] that featured Nigerian Fuji singer [[Adewale Ayuba]] in 2005. It won critical acclaim and the [[Kora Awards]] as "Best Group West Africa" and "Best Group Africa" 2005. This amongst other things promoted his move back to Lagos, Nigeria.

In 2006 he performed with Afrobeat Academy Band during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany. He has collaborated and toured with [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]] and [[Seun Kuti]]. In 2011 Ade Bantu's group BANTU released "No Man Stands Alone" an album of collaborations which was mostly recorded in Nigeria.
