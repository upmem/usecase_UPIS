[[File:St Etheldreda.jpg|thumb|St Etheldreda, a work by Trena Cox in St Stephen, Prenton, Birkenhead]]
'''Trena Mary Cox''' (1895–1980) was an English stained glass artist.  She was born Emma Trina Cox on 3 March 1895, in the Lower Bebington Urban District (i.e. not Bebbington), on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] and grew up around Birkenhead.<ref name="Jones 2012 11–14">{{Harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=11–14.}}</ref> She trained at the [[Laird School of Art]]. In 1924 she moved to Chester and set up her studio in Victoria Road [[Chester]], Cheshire, either adjacent to, or within, the Kaleyard works of Williams, Gamon & Co., with whom she remained associated until the Second World War.<ref group=note>Cox's first known stained glass window is in the Chester College (now University) chapel and was installed in October 1924 (Minutes of the Joint Committee, Chester Training College, 15 October 1924). This window has Trena Cox's monogram on it, yet the window was contracted to Williams, Gamon & Co. (The Collegian, Vol 38, No 1, 1925).</ref> In about 1945, Trena Cox moved to 96 Watergate Street, Chester,<ref group=note>Cox exhibited several times in the Walker Gallery Autumn Exhibitions in Liverpool. In the exhibition catalogue for the 1923 Autumn Exhibition, her home address is given as her parents' address in Birkenhead, as it also is for her 1924 exhibit at the Royal Academy in London. However, in the 1924 Walker Gallery Autumn Exhibition catalogue her address is given as being in Chester.

Trena Cox moved to 96 Watergate Street at some time around the Second World War. During the years up to and including 1939, electoral registers confirm that she was living at other addresses in Chester. However, by the time of the first electoral register after the war, in May 1945, she had moved to 96 Watergate St. However, she apparently continued using the Victoria Road studio alongside or within the Williams, Gamon & Co. works during the war and until at least 1946, with evidence including, for example, the Kelly's Directory of Cheshire, 1939 (p.&nbsp;94, p.&nbsp;584), the Kelly's Chester Directory of 1940 (p.&nbsp;112) and Chester Area telephone directories in January – February 1945 and March 1946. This suggests that she may not have used her new home as a studio immediately. By the time of the January 1947 telephone directory, however, the only telephone number for Trena Cox is at the Watergate Street address, suggesting a break from the Victoria Road studio.</ref> which remained her home and, at least later, her studio, until she retired in 1972 (at the age of 77) and died, on 11 February 1980<ref name="Jones 2012 11–14"/><ref>GRO 1980, Jan–Mar, Chester, v.35, p.0290</ref> (not in 1977, as frequently quoted). Most of her works are in churches in the old counties of Cheshire and Lancashire.<ref name="Jones 2012 11–14"/> She was a fellow of the [[British Society of Master Glass Painters]].<ref>{{Citation| url = http://www.sussexparishchurches.org/content/view/332/40| title = Architects and Artists C| access-date = 9 December 2011| publisher = Sussex Parish Shurches| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120305012935/http://www.sussexparishchurches.org/content/view/332/40| archive-date = 5 March 2012| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The authors of the ''[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of England]]'' series comment that "her windows are usually small, her figures modest, often with small-scale detail in the quarries" (small pieces of square or diamond-shaped glass set diagonally).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|p=72.}}</ref>

Until the publication of Jones (2012),<ref name="Jones 2012 11–14"/> there was very little coherent information available about the life of Trena Cox and errors in some earlier references, concerning, for example, the year of her death, have unfortunately been perpetuated by later authors.
