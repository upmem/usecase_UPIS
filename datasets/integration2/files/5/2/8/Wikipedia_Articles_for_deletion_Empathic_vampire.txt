The result was '''redirect''' to [[Energy vampire]].  There is nothing here to merge, and at least the target article makes it clear how scientific we're being. --- [[User:Deville|Deville]] ([[User talk:Deville|Talk]]) 16:11, 30 September 2006 (UTC)
===[[Empathic vampire]]===
Huh? This goes far beyond 'not citing sources'... --[[User:InShaneee|InShaneee]] 15:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' as empathic vampire is listed as a synonym for [[energy vampire]] [[User:FrozenPurpleCube|FrozenPurpleCube]] 15:36, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  [[WP:BOLLOCKS]].  I am not even sure where he gets that Persephone was an emphatic vampire (as he describes it) in the ''Matrix'' trilogy. [[User:Legis|Legis]] 15:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per [[WP:BOLLOCKS]] and [[WP:V]].-- [[User:danntm|danntm]] <sup>[[user talk:danntm|T]]</sup> <sub>[[Special:Contributions/Danntm|C]]</sub> 16:31, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Redirect''' However, the Persephone claim is out in left field. Is there a "WP:Delusions and Insanity" policy anywhere? 'Cause there seems to be a lot of delusional beliefs being deleted from Wikipedia lately. - [[User:CNichols|CNichols]] 21:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' this nonsense. Do not not not redirect to anything. [[User:Wryspy|Wryspy]] 19:16, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
There is nothing wrong with the article. Calm down. There is speculation among fans about Persephone's status as an empathic vampire because she was able to sense emotions during the club scene and at various points demanded kisses as payment, particularly specifing passionate kisses from which she recieved apparent satisfaction.
