This article appears to be about a non-notable MMA school.  It lacks notability and good independent sources.  It's strongest claim of notability is being the top ranked school by the Global Combat Alliance.  This appears to be a small local MMA organiztion where many of its fighter rankings consist of 2 fighters--each with 1 fight (apparently one beat the other).  The only independent source is the article from the Richmond Times, but it's unclear how reliable it is.  Quotes like "he claims" when talking about the school's owner makes it appear that the author did no checking on his own.  Some of the other articles don't even mention the school.

*'''Delete''' I struggle to find sources suggesting the school is notable outside to Virginia.  Looks like it fails [[WP:GNG]].  --[[User:TreyGeek|TreyGeek]] ([[User talk:TreyGeek|talk]]) 23:53, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Checking the Global Combat Alliance shows that they've sanctioned nearly 150 amateur MMA events over the course of 4 years.  Many of the fighters listed on this page have seemingly graduated from the amateur ranks in the GCA.  Both [http://www.sherdog.com/ Sherdog] and [http://www.mma.tv/ MMA.tv] prove that this school has fighters who have competed at levels such as [[Bellator]] and [[M-1 Global|M-1]].  And a quick Google search for 'Kyle Baker mma' shows articles, as recent as 6 days ago, commenting on his proximity to a [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] contract.[[User:Thebaronsg|TheBaronSG]] ([[User talk:Thebaronsg|talk]]) 15:11, 12 December 2011 (UTC) <small>— [[User:Thebaronsg|Thebaronsg]] ([[User talk:Thebaronsg|talk]]&#32;• [[Special:Contributions/Thebaronsg|contribs]]) has made [[Wikipedia:Single-purpose account|few or no other edits]] outside this topic. </small>
::This isn't about the notabiity of the GCA or Kyle Baker--it's about finding sources that actually focus on the MMA Institute.    There are none of those.  Also, using the fighters (even if they're notable) to show the school is notable runs afoul of [[WP:NOTINHERITED]].  BTW, Kyle Baker isn't on the verge of signing an MMA contract--he's apparently on the verge of trying out for The Ultimate Fighter for the third time.  He has no bouts for even a second tier organization. [[User:Astudent0|Astudent0]] ([[User talk:Astudent0|talk]]) 21:14, 13 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' As I mentioned above, there's no indication or sources that show this school is notable. [[User:Astudent0|Astudent0]] ([[User talk:Astudent0|talk]]) 21:14, 13 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I found nothing that shows this school is notable or has reliable sources that support notability. [[User:Papaursa|Papaursa]] ([[User talk:Papaursa|talk]]) 01:25, 16 December 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' None of the article's sources show the school is notable, some don't even mention it.  I  didn't find any good sources that support the school's notability and I agree with the comments by Mdtemp and Astudent0.
