'''Sean Daniel Maitland''' (born 14 September 1988) is a [[New Zealand]]-born [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[rugby union]] player. He plays for [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]] in the [[English Premiership (rugby union)|English Premiership]]. He previously played for [[London Irish RFC|London Irish]] and before that for [[Glasgow Warriors]] in the [[Pro14|PRO12]], [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] in [[Super Rugby]] and [[Canterbury RFU|Canterbury]] in the [[Mitre 10 Cup]].

==Early life==
Maitland was born in [[Tokoroa]], New Zealand, on 14 September 1988. He attended [[Hamilton Boys' High School]] where he played in the first XV and competed in athletics, recording a personal best of 11.29 and 22.30 seconds for the 100m and 200m respectively, and threw the discus 45.47m. Maitland is half-Scottish and is of Samoan and Maori descent from his mother's side. He is the cousin of New Zealand born, Australian rugby union player [[Quade Cooper]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theroar.com.au/2011/07/04/super-cooper-takes-on-crusading-cousin/ |title=Quade Cooper to play cousin Sean Maitland |first=Jim |last=Morton |work=theroar.com.au |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref> Maitland and cousin Cooper also grew up with future Kiwi Rugby League international [[Isaac John]].

==Rugby career==
Maitland spent 2005 and 2006 in the New Zealand Schools team and was a member of New Zealand under-19 World Cup winning side in 2007 and the New Zealand under-20 side in 2008 winning the IRB Junior World Championship. Sean scored four tries against teams from Argentina, Ireland and Wales.  One of his teammates was [[John Hardie (rugby union)|John Hardie]] who he would go on to play with in the Scotland Rugby Team.

Maitland debuted for [[Canterbury RFU|Canterbury]] in 2006, and made his [[Super Rugby]] debut for the Crusaders against the [[ACT Brumbies]] in 2008 and played in every Crusaders match that year. In 2010, he was selected for the [[New Zealand Maori rugby union team|New Zealand Maori]] where he impressed, scoring a try against Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Zealand Maori celebrate centenary with victory over Ireland|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jun/18/new-zealand-maori-ireland-centenary|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> On 11 March 2011 he scored four tries in a game against the Brumbies, equaling the record for the most tries scored in a Super Rugby match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Crusaders – Sean Maitland|url=http://www.crusaders.co.nz/profile/sean-maitland/18/player-details.aspx|accessdate=11 May 2011}}</ref>
Maitland joined [[Glasgow Warriors]] in 2012, and won his first cap for Scotland at the start of the [[2013 Six Nations Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sean Maitland|url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/scotland/player/sean-maitland|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> After 3 years playing for Glasgow Warriors, Maitland moved to [[London Irish]], and in 2016 to [[Saracens F.C.|Saracens]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sean Maitland|url=https://www.saracens.com/squad/senior/sean-maitland|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref> During his time at Saracens he has won two Premiership titles in 2018 and 2019, scoring a try in the 2019 final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/44212788|title=Premiership final: Exeter Chiefs 10-27 Saracens |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 May 2018 |accessdate=11 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48438232|title=Premiership final: Exeter Chiefs 34-37 Saracens|publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 June 2019 |accessdate=11 October 2020}}</ref> He also helped Saracens win the [[European Rugby Champions Cup|European Champions Cup]] in 2019, scoring a try in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48239893|title=Leinster 10-20 Saracens: English side win third Champions Cup in Newcastle|publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 May 2019 |accessdate=11 October 2020}}</ref> He had previously missed Saracens' victory in the 2017 [[European Rugby Champions Cup|European Champions Cup]] final through injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/39864097|title=Sean Maitland: Saracens winger may miss Scotland's summer tour |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=9 May 2017 |accessdate=13 October 2020}}</ref>

On 30 April 2013, Maitland was announced in the British and Irish Lions squad for the tour of Australia later that year. The tour marked a possible first encounter with cousin Quade Cooper in the test arena, having played one another before at Super Rugby level. The two never met in-game as Cooper was controversially left out of the extended Wallaby squad for the series, and Maitland never took to the field in the one test that he was on the bench. Maitland was not selected in the team to play the [[Queensland Reds]] mid-week game, in which Cooper captained the Reds for the first time.

Maitland played in the [[Rugby World Cup 2015]], in which Scotland reached the quarter-finals. He was controversially sin binned for a supposed deliberate knock-on in the quarter-finals. Scotland eventually went on to lose the match 35–34, ending their Rugby World Cup.

==Personal life==
Maitland qualifies for Scotland by his [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] grandparents who emigrated to New Zealand in the 1960s. Maitland said "My granddad always reminded me that I was part Scottish and that I should never forget that."<ref>{{cite web | first = Tom | last = English | work = The Scotsman| title=Six Nations: New Scot Sean Maitland keen to make big impact |url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby/top-rugby-stories/six-nations-new-scot-sean-maitland-keen-to-make-big-impact-1-2761435 | date=27 January 2013 |accessdate=31 January 2013}}</ref>

On his maternal grandfather's side, Sean is also closely related to [[Joe Stanley|'Smoking Joe' Stanley]] of New Zealand All Black fame in the mid 1980s–1990 on his Samoan side.{{citation needed|date = January 2013}} 
In 2009, Maitland was a finalist in the Cleo New Zealand Bachelor of the Year competition.<ref>{{cite web | title=CLEO Bachelors 09 |url=http://cleo.msn.co.nz/cleo-bachelors-2009/ |accessdate=30 April 2013}}</ref>

In November 2013, Maitland and three other Scottish rugby players were charged with assault following an incident outside a Glasgow takeaway shop in August,<ref>By [http://www.3news.co.nz/Sean-Maitland-among-Scotland-players-due-in-court-over-assault/tabid/415/articleID/321494/Default.aspx#.UoValeHIhnE Sean Maitland among Scotland players due in court over assault] ''3 News NZ''. 15 November 2013.</ref> although these were ultimately dropped and Maitland faced no further action.

In October 2020 Maitland was charged by the RFU for “conduct prejudicial to the interests of the Union”.
