'''Khadim Hussain Khan''' (1907–1993) was an Indian singer born in [[Atrauli]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. Initiated into music by his father Altaf Hussain Khan, he went on to learn from his grand uncle Ustad Kallan Khan. They were both court musicians of the Jaipur Kingdom.

==Musical Career==
The ustad settled in Bombay from the late twenties and was associated with musical life in Mumbai for several decades. He was a capable performer, with the ability to show forth the unique features of the Agra Gharana style and all its eight angs. However, it was as an ideal teacher that he will be remembered. Although he had been a broadcaster since the inception of AIR, he made teaching his life`s mission. In that role, he generously shared his vidya with his shishyas in the true manner of a traditional guru. Among his students are Ustad Latafat Hussain Khan, Saguna Kalyanpur, [[Lalith J. Rao]] and [[Babanrao Haldankar]]

He was a sensitive composer of bandishes and taranas under the nom-de-plume of "Sajan Piya". A number of his compositions take pride of place in the repertoire of agra gharana performers today. He composed a number of bhajans as well.
