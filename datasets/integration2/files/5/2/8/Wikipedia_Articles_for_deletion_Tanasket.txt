I have searched but have been unable to find any evidence that this word is in common usage.  The article is unreferenced; even with one or two references it may only be appropriate to merge to [[horse meat]].  (In short: fails [[WP:GNG]].)

*'''Delete''' - I don't see anything about it anywhere. It could be made up for all we know. [[WP:BURDEN]] applies, so the article's writer must provide evidence to avoid deletion. [[User:Richard-of-Earth|Richard-of-Earth]] ([[User talk:Richard-of-Earth|talk]]) 21:50, 9 December 2011 (UTC)
