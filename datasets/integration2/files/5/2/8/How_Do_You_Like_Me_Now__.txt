'''''How Do You Like Me Now?!''''' is the fifth studio album from [[United States|American]] [[country music]] artist [[Toby Keith]]. It was his first album for [[DreamWorks Records]] after leaving [[Mercury Records]]. After buying the master, Keith gave the album to DreamWorks.<ref>https://calgaryherald.com/entertainment/Keith+never+mince+words/5596280/story.html</ref> The lead single, "When Love Fades", peaked at #44 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts because it was pulled for the follow-up single (which was the title track) that spent five weeks at number one on the same chart, in addition to reaching #31 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Keith's biggest hit at the time. Furthermore, "How Do You Like Me Now?!" was declared the number-one country song of 2000 according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. The third and fourth singles from this album, respectively, were "Country Comes to Town" (#4 on Hot Country Songs) and "You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This", which spent three non-contiguous weeks at number one on the country chart as well. Overall, the album was certified platinum in the U.S. for sales of one million copies.
