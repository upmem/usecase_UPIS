'''NetWare Link Services Protocol''' (NLSP) is a [[routing]] protocol for [[Internetwork Packet Exchange]] based on the Intermediate-System-to-Intermediate-System ([[IS-IS]]) protocol developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO).  NLSP enables [[NetWare]] servers to exchange routing and service information without the high broadcast overhead generated by [[Routing Information Protocol]] and [[Service Advertising Protocol]].  Instead of periodically retransmitting its information every few minutes like RIP and SAP, NLSP only transmits every two hours, or when there is a change in a route or service, making it much more suitable for use over a [[Wide Area Network]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Novell NetWare 6: NetWare Link Services protocol Migration|publisher=Novell Inc.|location=Provo, Utah|url=https://www.novell.com/documentation/nw6p/pdfdoc/nlsp_enu/nlsp_enu.pdf|date=October 2001|accessdate=2015-02-27}}</ref>
