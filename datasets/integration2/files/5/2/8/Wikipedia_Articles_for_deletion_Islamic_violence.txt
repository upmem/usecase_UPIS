The result was '''Delete'''. <b>[[User:Ohnoitsjamie|OhNo<font color="#D47C14">itsJamie</font>]] [[User talk:Ohnoitsjamie|<sup>Talk</sup>]]</b> 17:48, 24 September 2006 (UTC) 
===[[Islamic violence]]===
A POV magnet. We already have [[Islamic extremist terrorism]], [[Islamic fundamentalism]], [[Islamofascism]], [[Militant Islam]], etc... Also note that the newly created article is just a list of [[Sura]]s which may imply violence. The rest is purely OR.-- ''[[User:FayssalF|Szvest]] 15:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)'' 

*'''Keep''' Sure sure, but those all say nothing of the words of the Qur'an that imply violence directly, and that there might be some linkage between violence and islam itself, rather than just extremists. Since there is debate at the current time about this, there should be a page noting such occurences in the Qur'an - to delete this would be BIASED toward Islam. - [[User:Malrak dossta|Malrak Dossta]] 15:48, 18 September 2006 (UTC) ''(article author)''

*'''Delete''' This page is not up to WP standards and should be deleted. While the topic is valid and of current interest, it lacks any substantial anaylsis of violence in Islam. Instead it offers quotes refering to violence is Islamic texts. The intent of the author indeed seems to be to push a POV and promote a website. A better (more analytical, neutral POV) pre-existing article on the subject is [[Criticism of Islam]], which links off the [[Islam]] main article. [[User:Neobolts|Neobolts]] 15:50, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Speedy Delete''' for recreation of hitherto deleted material. This is pretty much the same thing as the recently deleted [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Intolerant_Quran_verses|Intolerant Quran verses]]. [[user:BhaiSaab|BhaiSaab]] <sup>[[user talk:BhaiSaab|talk]]</sup> 16:07, 18 September 2006 (UTC) 

*'''Delete''' For one, this page doesn't even come ''close'' to WP standards. And second, any relevant quotes can easily be merged into the existing articles on Islamic violence (as listed by Szvest above). Standing by itself, this list of quotes doesn't really give the reader any deeper understanding of the issue at hand. --[[User:Frescard|Frescard]] 16:22, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per Neobolts, also probably fails [[WP:NOT]] a soapbox. {{User:Methnor/Signature}}

*'''Delete''' per Frescard. Contents can be merged into one of the existing articles (maybe). --[[User:Gabi S.|Gabi S.]] 18:38, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. Without any context provided by secondary sources, this verges on OR. Context is (or at least should be) provided in the articles cited by the nominator. Deletion will not in fact result in a pro-Islam bias. [[User:BigHaz|BigHaz]] - [[User_talk:BigHaz|Schreit mich an]] ([[Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz|Review me]]) 21:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' per Neobolts and BigHaz. [[User:WU03|WU03]] 00:47, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. I've prodded today some OR pro-Islamic and pro-Catholic articles as well. This has nothing to do with bias but everything with the difference between an encyclopedia and a free webhost for your ideas. [[User:Fram|Fram]] 13:08, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' Very useful markers for location of violent related clauses in scripture. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:202.154.65.186|202.154.65.186]] ([[User talk:202.154.65.186|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/202.154.65.186|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
:Such information is already available (in whatever context you want) in other articles mentioned in this AfD discussion. Why does it need to be duplicated here?

*'''Keep''' Notable topic.  Perhaps a more descriptive title as the theory that this article is (badly) describing is that Islam is an inherently more violent religion than others.  [[User:JASpencer|JASpencer]] 10:12, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Speedy delete.''' It is a bunch of Quran copied and pasted quotes. No context, no analysis, no sources. [[User:Arbustoo|Arbusto]] 17:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
