:* I have corrected the grammar to "genus ''Archboldomys''" from the original "''Archboldomys'' genus".  This is standard grammar for scientific taxa, much like it is standard grammar to say "city of Paris" and not "Paris city", or to say "he wrote under the name Twain" instead of "he wrote under the Twain name".  The head of the noun phrase is the scientific name; the rank of that name (e.g. "genus") is an attributive noun modifying the head.  To reverse these is to say that "genus" is modified somehow by the proper noun ''Archboldomys''. --[[User:EncycloPetey|EncycloPetey]] ([[User talk:EncycloPetey|talk]]) 04:39, 23 December 2011 (UTC)
:*[[File:Symbol question.svg|16px]] Article is long enough and new enough. Although the hook is not awfully interesting, I find that the hook fact is supported by cited sources. However, as a whole, the article is not as well-supported by sources. The second paragraph of "Description" has no footnotes. Also, much of the content of the "Distribution and habitat" section is cited to the IUCN redlist page, but that source does not contain the information attributed to it. This is important, since it seems inconsistent to indicate that the species is widespread if only 22 specimens have ever been found. Better sourcing is needed before this can go to the main page. --[[User:Orlady|Orlady]] ([[User talk:Orlady|talk]]) 00:42, 26 December 2011 (UTC)
