His name comes from a series of 4 paintings depicting the Flagellation of Jesus, Pilate shows Jesus to the people, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection. These paintings were held in the church at [[Beigem]], near Brussels, until 13 September 1914 when they were stolen just before the church was set on fire by the Germans in World War I. They are currently only known from photos. In 2014 the city council of [[Grimbergen]] offered a reward of 400,000 euros for information regarding the paintings.<ref>[http://www.bruzz.be/nl/nieuws/grimbergen-looft-400000-euro-uit-voor-vier-verdwenen-schilderijen Belgian news article] about the 4 lost paintings</ref>
