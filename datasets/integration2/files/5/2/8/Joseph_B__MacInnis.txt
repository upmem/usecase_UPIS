MacInnis currently studies leadership in high risk environments and gives leadership presentations in North America and Europe. His audiences have included Microsoft, IBM, National Geographic, Rolex, Visa, Toyota and the U.S. Naval Academy.

MacInnis led ten research expeditions under the [[Arctic Ocean]]. He was among the first people to dive to the [[Wreck of the RMS Titanic|wreck of the RMS ''Titanic'']]. In 2012 he was a medical advisor and journalist on the [[James Cameron]]-[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] seven-mile science dive into the [[Mariana Trench]].

MacInnis has worked with the [[U.S. Navy]], the [[Canadian Forces]] and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]. He has written ten books. His latest, ''Deep Leadership: Essential Insights from High Risk Environments'', was published by Random House. Currently, he is producing a multimedia project, CARRY THE FIRE, to inspire enterprise, optimism and leadership in young people.

== Education and early career ==
MacInnis is of [[Isle of Mull]] Scottish descent.<ref name="Library"/> He was born in [[Barrie, Ontario]], but grew up in [[Toronto]], where his family moved after his father, a [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] instructor, died in a plane crash when MacInnis was a few months old.<ref name="Library"/><ref name="UofT">{{cite journal|first=Gerald|last=Hannon|title=Breathing Underwater|journal=U of T Magazine|date=Winter 2005|publisher=[[University of Toronto]]|url=http://www.magazine.utoronto.ca/winter-2005/joseph-macinnis-underwater-explorer-swimming-under-north-pole/|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref> MacInnis was raised by his mother, who remarried when he was 12.<ref name="UofT"/> He attended high school at [[Upper Canada College]].<ref name="Library"/>

== Man-In-Sea and Ocean Systems ==
After his junior internship, MacInnis hoped to work with inventor and entrepreneur [[Edwin Link]] in the field of deep diving, but had no idea how to reach him. In fall 1963 MacInnis placed a person-to-person telephone call to Link, who agreed to meet with him for fifteen minutes the next day at the [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] At the interview, Link offered MacInnis a position as the full-time doctor for his Man-In-Sea Project.<ref name="UM"/><ref name="Website"/> MacInnis received a Link Foundation Fellowship to study diving medicine under [[Christian J.

In June–July 1964, MacInnis participated as a [[life support]] specialist when Link conducted his second Man in Sea experiment in the [[Berry Islands]] (a chain in the [[Bahamas]]) with [[Robert Sténuit]] and [[Jon Lindbergh]], one of the sons of [[Charles Lindbergh]]. Sténuit and Lindbergh stayed in Link's SPID [[Underwater habitat|habitat]] (Submersible, Portable, Inflatable Dwelling) for 49 hours underwater at a depth of 432 feet, breathing a helium-oxygen mixture.<ref name="UM"/><ref name="Marion"/><ref name="NGM 1">{{cite journal |last=Sténuit |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Sténuit |date=April 1965 |title=The Deepest Days |journal=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=534–547 |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref><ref name="Sténuit">{{cite book |last=Sténuit |first=Robert |title=The Deepest Days |others=Trans.

In March 1967, Link launched ''[[Deep Diver]]'', the first small [[submersible]] designed for lockout diving, allowing divers to leave and enter the craft while underwater.<ref name="Marion"/> ''Deep Diver'' carried out many scientific missions in 1967 and 1968, including a 430-foot lockout dive in 1967 (at the same location as the 1964 Sténuit-Lindbergh dive) and a 700-foot lockout dive near [[Great Stirrup Cay]] in 1968. MacInnis participated in both of these dives as an observer in ''Deep Diver'''s forward chamber.<ref name="UM"/><ref name="Marion"/><ref name="NGM 2">{{cite journal |last=MacLeish |first=Kenneth |date=January 1968 |title=A Taxi for the Deep Frontier: Project Man-in-Sea Goes Mobile |journal=National Geographic |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=138–150 |publisher=National Geographic Society}}</ref>

In September 1967 MacInnis took part in a classified Ocean Systems mission aboard ''Deep Diver'' on the [[Grand Banks]] south of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. A cable plow, rumored to be used for burying a strategic communications cable, had been lost in 400 feet of water. Two Navy divers had already been killed trying to recover it. MacInnis was one of a crew of four Ocean Systems personnel who unsuccessfully attempted to recover the cable plow using the submersible. The mission was called off due to rising winds, and ''Deep Diver'' was barely brought safely back aboard the [[Canadian Coast Guard]] vessel CCGS ''John Cabot''.<ref name="UM"/><ref name="Marion"/> In 1968 MacInnis took part in a [[Saturation diving|saturation dive]] aboard the [[Underwater habitat#Hydrolab|Hydrolab underwater habitat]] with two other [[aquanaut]]s, spending 50 hours at a depth of 50 feet,<ref name="Living1">{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=James W.|last2=Koblick|first2=Ian G.|author-link2=Underwater habitat#La Chalupa Research Laboratory|title=Living and Working in the Sea|publisher=[[Van Nostrand Reinhold|Van Nostrand Reinhold Company]]|year=1984|location=New York, New York|page=79|isbn=0-442-26084-9}}</ref> and in the search for the lost submarine [[USS Scorpion (SSN-589)|USS ''Scorpion'']].<ref name="DL 2">''Deep Leadership'' (MacInnis), pp. 63-64.</ref> In late 1968 and early 1969, MacInnis took part in salvage operations after the crash of [[Pan Am Flight 217]] near [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]].<ref name="Library"/><ref name="UM"/>

== The ''Breadalbane'' ==
While diving in 1975, MacInnis found a fragment of the ''[[Breadalbane (ship)|Breadalbane]]'', the northernmost known shipwreck in the world, a British [[merchant ship]] that sank in the [[Arctic]] in 1853. MacInnis headed the first expedition to find the wreck of ''Breadalbane'' in August 1978. In August 1980, after a three-year search, the ship was discovered by Coast Guard cutter ''John A. Macdonald'' using side-scan sonar. The first images showed her hull intact and two of her masts still standing.<ref name="NS">{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=Doug|title=Technology lights up an Arctic shipwreck|journal=[[New Scientist]]|volume=89|issue=1236|pages=136–139|publisher=[[Reed Business Information]]|issn=0262-4079|date=15 January 1981|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PPaa1QhujcwC|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref><ref name="google2000">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J9W4QO1b_A8C|last=Paine|first=Lincoln P.|title=Ships of Discovery and Exploration|location=[[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]|year=2000|pages=26–27|isbn=0-395-98415-7|accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref><ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia2">{{cite web|first=Joseph B |last=MacInnis |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000968 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130203173045/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0000968 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |title=Breadalbane |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=December 27, 2011 }}</ref>

In 1981, supported by the Canadian Coast Guard, the [[National Geographic Society]], and others, the group returned. A remotely piloted submersible was used to examine the wreck, which took the first colour photographs and video footage. The images showed the bow, masts, rudder and anchor. The wood appeared new.<ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia2"/>

In 1983, further visits to the ''Breadalbane'' were conducted by ''[[Sea-Otter (submersible)|Sea-Otter]]'', a submersible, and the [[WASP (diving suit)|WASP]], an [[atmospheric diving suit]] similar to the [[Newtsuit]].<ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia2"/><ref name="NGM 4">{{cite journal|last=MacInnis |first=Joseph B. |pages=104A–104D |date=July 1983 |title=Exploring a 140-Year-Old Ship Under Arctic Ice |journal=National Geographic |location=Washington, D.C. |volume=164 |issue=1 |publisher=National Geographic Society}}</ref>
