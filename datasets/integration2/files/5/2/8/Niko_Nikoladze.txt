'''Niko [[Nikoladze]]''' ({{lang-ka|ნიკო ნიკოლაძე}}) (27 September 1843 – 5 June 1928) was a notable [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] writer, pro-[[Western world|Western]] enlightener, and public figure primarily known for his contributions to the development of Georgian liberal journalism and his involvement in various economic and social projects of that time.  

He was born in the village of [[Samtredia Municipality|Didi Jikhaishi]], [[Imereti]], western Georgia (then part of the [[Russian Empire]]) into [[aznauri|petite noble]] family of [[Nikoladze]]. After the graduation from [[Kutaisi]] Gymnasium (1860), he enrolled the Faculty of Law at [[St Petersburg University]] in 1861. In the same year he was excluded from the university for taking part in student protests. After leaving St. Petersburg he went to study in [[Western Europe]] in 1864 and became the first Georgian to receive a doctorate (in law) from a European university, namely in [[University of Zurich|Zurich]] (1868). Like many other Georgian intellectuals of that time, he followed the evolution of Russian liberals to different versions of [[socialism]], establishing his own contacts with the Western leftist thinkers. Nikoladze was the first Georgian figure within this trend to gain position of influence in all-Russian liberalist movements. During his stay in Zurich, through [[Paul Lafargue]] he met [[Karl Marx]], who asked Nikoladze to become the representative of the [[International Workingmen's Association|International]] in [[Transcaucasia]]. Nikoladze declined the offer because at that time his views were closer with the Russian revolutionary democrats, [[Nikolai Chernyshevsky]] and [[Nikolay Aleksandrovich Dobrolyubov|Nikolay Dobrolyubov]], whom he had met in St. Petersburg. While in Europe, he briefly collaborated with [[Aleksandr Herzen]] in his influential newspaper, ''[[Kolokol (newspaper)|Kolokol]]'' (''The Bell''), in 1865, but Nikoladze soon broke with Herzen when the latter sent a reconciliatory open letter to the [[tsar]]. 

Back in his native Georgia, he became involved in national-liberation movement inspired by Georgia’s most famous intellectual of that time Prince [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] though Nikoladze’s relations with Chavchavadze were not always easy. Nikoladze joined a more radical wing of this movement later named the Second Group (''[[meore dasi]]'') and quickly became one of its most influential leaders. This group sought widely for a program, ranging from state-regulated [[capitalism]] to various forms of "association" and [[collectivism]], and worked to introduce European learning and culture in Georgia. They became the first Georgian political team to stress the importance of the urban and economic life of Georgia. They actively implemented their ideas into practice and worked to keep the Georgians from being pushed aside by the [[Russians]] and [[Armenians]] who dominated the Georgian cities, particularly the capital, [[Tiflis]]. He gained almost a scandalous name by publishing his sarcastic article, "A Thought on Likhi Mountain" (1871), where he compared Tiflis to an old whore, the wide, paved avenues, parks, and theaters being just her make-up, while the markets are her blackened teeth and the cemeteries and war-devastated fields her raddled body. Nikoladze’s rhetoric attacks on the representatives of the older generation, who mostly chose to serve loyally to the Russian administration, further strengthened positions of the "men of the 60s," a backbone of younger Georgian intellectuals forming an opposition to the Tsarist regime.           

From 1871 to 1875, Nikoladze lived between Paris and Tbilisi, organizing several revolutionary periodicals such as ''Krebuli'' in Tbilisi (1871), ''Drosha'' in Paris (1873) and ''Mimokhilva'' in Tbilisi.<ref name="Mikaberidze 2015">{{cite book |last=Mikaberidze |first=Alexander |title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNNQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA499 |edition=2nd |date=2015 |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |location=Lanham, Maryland |isbn=978-1-4422-4146-6 |page=499}}</ref> While he was in Paris, he married a Polish woman, Bogumila Zemaianskaia (also Bogumiła Ziemiańska), who had lived for a while in his hometown of Kutaisi. They had three children — a son who died young, and two daughters, Nino (born 1872) and Elizabeth, known as "Lolo".<ref name="Abzianidze 2012">{{cite magazine |ref=harv |last1=Abzianidze |first1=Zaza |title=The Architect of Future Georgia |url=https://issuu.com/moditogeorgia/docs/modi_issuu |date=February 2012|magazine=Modi to Georgia |publisher=Publishing House Modi Ltd. |location=Tbilisi, Georgia |oclc=1003149930 |pages=36-41}}</ref><ref name="ჭილაძე 2003">{{cite web |last1=ჭილაძე |first1=თინა |title=ნიკოლაძეთა ოჯახის ქალები |url=http://www.bu.org.ge/x1190?page=1&tab=2 |website=bu.org.ge |publisher=[[Tbilisi State University]] |accessdate=3 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002232254/http://www.bu.org.ge/x1190?page=1&tab=2 |archivedate=2 October 2019 |location=Tbilisi, Georgia |language=Georgian |trans-title=Women of the Nikoladze Family |date=2003 |id=Niko Nikoladze 160: Anniversary Collection, MFN: 68783, p=78-84}}</ref> He returned to Tbilisi in 1875, but was arrested for his radical publications and expelled to [[Stavropol]] in 1880.<ref name="Mikaberidze 2015" /> Separated from Zemaianskaia, he was accompanied to Russia by [[Olga Guramishvili-Nikoladze|Olga Guramishvili]], whom he would marry after he was officially divorced in 1883.<ref name="Abzianidze 2012" /><ref name="ჭილაძე 2003" />

Despite the strong governmental censure and pressure exerted upon Nikoladze, he remained an influential and respected writer not only in Georgia, but also in Russia proper. Many of his best writings composed in Russian, and French were systematically published in the European press. The climax of Nikoladze's activity was his successful negotiations in the mid-1880s with [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] and his government that reduced the nationwide repressions and saved [[Vera Figner]] from the gallows and Chernyshevsky from exile.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In 1884, Nikoladze and Guramishvili were living in Saint Petersburg, where their daughter [[Rusudan Nikoladze-Polievktova|Rusudan]] (1884-1981) was born.<ref name="Karaulshchikov et al.">{{cite web |last1=Karaulshchikov |first1=Taras |last2=Kinslow |first2=Kenneth |last3=Lyandres |first3=Natasha |title=Polievktov-Nikoladze Family Papers |url=https://archivesspace.library.nd.edu/repositories/3/resources/1598 |website=[[Hesburgh Library]] |publisher=[[University of Notre Dame]] |accessdate=11 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011194608/https://archivesspace.library.nd.edu/repositories/3/resources/1598 |archivedate=11 October 2019 |location=Notre Dame, Indiana |date=2017 |id=collection #MSE/REE 0001}}</ref> From 1886, he led the liberal group ''Meore Dasi''<ref name="Mikaberidze 2015" /> and though his family lived in [[Samtredia Municipality|Didi Jikhaishi]], in the [[Imereti]] region of western Georgia,<ref name="Abzianidze 2012" /><ref name="ჭილაძე 2003" /> Nikoladze served as the editor of ''Novoe oborzrenie'' in Tbilisi.<ref name="Mikaberidze 2015" /> He and Olga's other two children {{ill|Giorgi Nikoladze|lt=Giorgi|ka|გიორგი ნიკოლაძე}} (1888-1931) and Tamara (1892-1939), were born in Didi Jikhaishi.<ref name="O'Connor & Robertson 2018" >{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=John J. |last2=Robertson |first2=Edmund F. |title=Nikoloz Muskhelishvili |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Muskhelishvili.html |website=MacTutor History of Mathematics Archive |publisher=School of Mathematics and Statistics [[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=11 October 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011181720/http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Muskhelishvili.html |archivedate=11 October 2019 |location=St Andrews, Fife, Scotland |date=September 2018}}</ref> Also living as part of their family was his eldest daughter Nino.<ref name="ჭილაძე 2003" />  

As a notable public benefactor, Nikoladze was responsible for a number of social and economic projects, including the expansion of railway systems in Georgia and the construction of the [[Grozny]]-[[Poti]] pipeline. From 1894 to 1912, Nikoladze was elected a [[mayor]] of Poti. During his tenure as a mayor, he made this small portal town on Georgia’s [[Black Sea]] coast an important maritime city and trading center. 

Soon after the 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia, Nikoladze allied himself with more radical Georgian [[intelligentsia]], supporting Georgia’s full independence from Russia. He was elected an honorary chairman of the National Democratic Party of Georgia. During the years of the first [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgian republic]] (1918-1921), he was actively involved in the nation's social and economic life. In 1920 he led a delegation of the [[Chiatura]] [[Manganese]] Exporting Society in Europe. He was still abroad, when the short-lived Georgian independence was terminated by the [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia's]] military invasion in 1921. Yet Nikoladze decided to return to [[Georgian SSR|Soviet Georgia]], retreating into a world of theory, preaching education and reform instead of violent revolution.

His daughters from his first marriage, Nino, married Levan Zurabishvili and Lolo married the Belgian writer and statesman, [[Camille Huysmans]].<ref name="ჭილაძე 2003" /> From his second marriage Rusudan became a chemist and married Russian historian Mikhail Polievktov.{{sfn|Lyandres|2014|p=11}} Giorgi became a mathematician and Tamara married one of Giorgi's colleagues, [[Nikoloz Muskhelishvili]].<ref name="O'Connor & Robertson 2018" />
