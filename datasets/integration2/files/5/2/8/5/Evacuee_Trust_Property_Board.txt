The Evacuee Trust Property Board, ({{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|'''ہیئت  تولیتیی املاکِ متروکہ'''}}}}) a statutory board of the [[Government of Pakistan]], is a key government department which administers evacuee properties, including educational, charitable or religious trusts left behind by Hindus and Sikhs who migrated to [[India]] after partition. It also maintains places of worship belonging to Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan.<ref name=ET1>[http://www.etpb.gov.pk/ Evacuee Trust Property Board]</ref>

==Members==
The board has 6 official and 18 non-official members. Currently,{{When?|date=September 2020}} six of the official members are Muslims and of the out of the 18 non-official members, only eight are from the minority Hindu and Sikh communities.<ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chandigarh/pak-hindu-leader-challenges-rejection-of-bill-on-evacuee-board/articleshow/71431905.cms</ref>

==Background==
The Evacuee Trust Property Board was established in 1960 to look after the temples and land left over by Sikhs and Hindus who migrated to India during partition in 1947 and 1948. The board functions under the Act (Management & Disposal) No. XIII of 1975. The board was started as a result of Nehru-Liaqat Pact in 1950 and Pant Mirza Agreement in 1955 to guarantee the rights of the minority Hindus and Sikhs.<ref>https://www.etpb.gov.pk/about-etpb/</ref>

==Properties==
The board controls and manages 109,404 acres of agricultural land and 46,499 acres of built-up urban sub-units<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/agpr-starts-audit-of-kartarpur-corridor-audi-774039.html|title=AGPR Starts Audit Of Kartarpur Corridor: Audit Officials|website=UrduPoint|language=en|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref> in accordance with “Scheme for the Lease of Evacuee Trust Agricultural Land, 1975” and “Schemes for the Management and Disposal of Urban Evacuee Trust Properties, 1977.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} (Evacuee Trust Properties essentially are the properties attached to charitable, religious or educational trust or institutions.)

===Healthcare===
The board runs the Janki Devi Jamiat Singh Hospital and seven health centers.

===Educational Institutes===
The following educational institutions are functioning and imparting free education to minorities:
* Hazrat Ayesha Sadiqa Degree College Lahore
* Dr. Mateen Fatima Trust model School
* Trust Model Public High School

==Corruption==
In December 2017, during the hearing of a case on Katas Raj Temple in Chakwal, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, [[Mian Saqib Nisar]], expressed displeasure at the absence or displacing of idols from the temples, demanding to know why there were no statues in the temples of Shiri Ram and Hanuman. The bench was told that Asif Hashmi, a former chairman  of Evacuee Trust Property Board, earned millions of rupees from corruption [during his tenure] and then left [Pakistan].<ref>{{cite news|title=SC bars lower courts from hearing cases on Katas Raj temple|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1376151|accessdate=12 December 2017|agency=The Dawn newspaper|date=12 December 2017}}</ref> The chairman of the board, at that time, Mr. Saddique, also highlighted his "fight against corruption" [within the board] in his message on the board's website.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chairman’s Message|url=http://www.etpb.gov.pk/chairman-message/|accessdate=12 December 2017|agency=The Dawn newspaper|date= December 2017}}</ref>

==Criticism==
===No minority representation===
The ETP board is often criticised for not having enough Hindu and Sikhs members on the board. During the signing of Liaqat-Nehru pact, both Pakistan and India agreed to appoint a Muslim head in India and a Hindu head in Pakistan to look after evacuee property. However, since independence, the Pakistan government never appointed a Hindu citizen as chairman.<ref>https://wap.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/pak-hindu-council-criticises-appointment-of-muslim-as-etpb-chairman-119050601162_1.html</ref> Currently,{{when?|date=September 2020}} all six official members are Muslims and of the 18 non-official members, only eight are from the minority Hindu and Sikh communities. In 2018, [[Ramesh Kumar Vankwani]], Hindu member of the national assembly, presented the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and Disposal) Bill 2018 which says that only a Hindu or Sikh should be appointed as the chairperson of the Evacuee Trust Property Board. However, the bill was rejected by the assembly’s standing committee on religious affairs in 2019.<ref>https://m.timesofindia.com/city/chandigarh/pak-hindu-leader-challenges-rejection-of-bill-on-evacuee-board/articleshow/71431905.cms</ref>

===Leasing Hindu Temples===
The Evacuee Trust Property Board has been criticised for leasing sacred Hindu temples to land grabbers. The board rented out the historic Kali Bari Hindu Temple to a Muslim party in Dera Ismail Khan.{{when?|date=September 2020}} This historic temple is being converted and used as the Taj Mahal Hotel. Frontier Constabulary officials, with the help of the board, have occupied the Shamshan Ghaat in Dera Ismail Khan and the Hindu community is unable to cremate their dead because of the unavailability of Shamshan Ghaat and is forced to bury them in a graveyard shared my members of other faiths.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/686952/95-of-worship-places-put-to-commercial-use-survey/?amp=1</ref>
