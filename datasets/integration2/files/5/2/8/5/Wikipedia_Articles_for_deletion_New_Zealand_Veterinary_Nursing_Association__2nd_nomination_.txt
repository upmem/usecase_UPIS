The result was '''keep'''. This was a close one, but the Keep voters were more persuasive.  [[User:MelanieN|MelanieN]] ([[User talk:MelanieN|talk]]) 00:06, 6 June 2016 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' but '''merge''' with [[Paraveterinary workers in New Zealand]]. Enough information to meet notability but the article needs a tidy up [[User:NealeFamily|NealeFamily]] ([[User talk:NealeFamily|talk]]) 00:19, 23 May 2016 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' AND Redirect as this current article is noticeably hinting at promotional and is otherwise simply not convincing of an acceptable.

* '''Keep''' - Passes GNG from sources already showing in the footnotes. If there is a merge to be, it should be from the smaller and weaker [[Paraveterinary workers in New Zealand]] piece to this one, not vice-versa. But who's gonna actually ''do the work?''

*'''Delete'''.  I'm not seeing the notability here.  For an organization that has been around for fifteen years, I would expect to see more in the way of significant third-party sourcing, but that's not the case here.  As for merging to [[Paraveterinary workers in New Zealand]], I have no objection to a merge, but the proposed target seems to be in even worse shape than the instant article.  It starts out by telling us that veterinary nurses are <u>not</u> considered "paraveterinary" workers, but then proceeds to talk about them anyway.  By the way, I suspect there is an undeclared conflict of interest here -- the article's creator and chief contributor is a single-purpose account named LHarvey, and one of the members of the subject's executive board is a Laura Harvey (as seen [http://www.nzvna.org.nz/About+Us/Meet+Your+Executive+-+Officers/-+Executive+members.html?__utma=1.1254026396.1464920623.1464920623.1464920623.1&__utmb=1.1.10.1464920623&__utmc=1&__utmx=-&__utmz=1.1464920623.1.1.utmcsr=nzvna.org.nz|utmccn=(referral)|utmcmd=referral|utmcct=/About%20Us/Meet%20Your%20Executive%20-%20Officers.html&__utmv=-&__utmk=109919365 here]).
