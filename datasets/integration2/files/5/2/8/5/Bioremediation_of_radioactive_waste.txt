'''Bioremediation of radioactive waste''' or '''bioremediation of radionuclides''' is an application of [[bioremediation]] based on the use of biological agents [[bacteria]], [[plants]] and [[fungi]] (natural or [[genetically modified]]) to catalyze [[chemical reactions]] that allow the decontamination of sites affected by [[radionuclides]].<ref name="nabir">{{cite book|url=http://doesbr.org/documents/03_NABIR_primer.pdf|editor=A NABIR Primer|last1=Faison|first1=B|last2=McCullough|first2=J|last3=Hazen|first3=TC|last4=Benson|first4=SM|last5=Palmisano|first5=A|title=Bioremediation of metals and radionuclides: What it is and how it works|edition=2nd edition.

The techniques of bioremediation of environmental areas as [[soil]], [[water]] and [[sediments]] contaminated by radionuclides are diverse and currently being set up as an ecological and economic alternative to traditional procedures. Physico-chemical conventional strategies are based on the extraction of waste by excavating and drilling, with a subsequent long-range transport for their final confinement. These works and transport have often unacceptable estimated [[cost of operation|costs of operation]] that could exceed a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[United States dollar|dollars]] in the [[US]] and 50 [[million]] [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the [[UK]].<ref name="prakash">{{cite journal|title=Bioremediation: a genuine technology to remediate radionuclides from the environment|last1=Prakash|first1=D|last2=Gabani|first2=P|last3=Chandel|first3=A.K|last4=Ronen|first4=Z|last5=Singh|first5=O.V|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|year= 2013|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12059|pages=349–360|pmc=3917470|place=New York|pmid=23617701}}</ref>

The species involved in these processes have the ability to influence the properties of radionuclides such as [[solubility]], [[bioavailability]] and [[Motion (physics)|mobility]] to accelerate its stabilization. Its action is largely influenced by [[electron donors]] and [[electron acceptors|acceptors]], [[nutrient medium]], complexation of radioactive particles with the material and [[environmental factors]].

===Typology of radionuclides and polluting waste===
{{main|Radioactive waste}}
The presence of radioactive waste in the environment may cause long-term effects due to the [[Specific activity|activity]] and [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of the radionuclides, leading their impact to grow with time.<ref name="prakash"/> These particles exist in various [[oxidation states]] and are found as [[oxides]], [[coprecipitation|coprecipitates]], or as [[organic chemical|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical|inorganic]] complexes, according to their origin and ways of liberation. Most commonly they are found in oxidized form, which makes them more soluble in water and thus more mobile.<ref name="in situ"/> Unlike organic contaminants, however, they cannot be destroyed and must be converted into a stable form or extracted from the environment.<ref name="brookhaven">{{cite conference|url=https://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/32628.pdf|title=Microbial Transformations of Radionuclides and Environmental Restoration Through Bioremediation|date=2006|conference=Symposium on "Emerging Trends in Separation Science and Technology"|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|first=A.J|last=Francis|place=Mumbai}}</ref>

The sources of radioactivity are not exclusive of human activity. The [[natural radioactivity]] does not come from human sources: it covers up to ¾ of the total radioactivity in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy [[cosmic rays]] ([[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic radionuclides]]) or in the existing materials on [[Earth]] since its formation ([[primordial nuclide|primordial radionuclides]]). In this regard, there are differences in the levels of radioactivity throughout the [[Earth's crust]]. [[India]] and mountains like the [[Alps]] are among the areas with the highest level of natural radioactivity due to their composition of [[rocks]] and [[sand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csn.es/radiacion-natural-y-artificial2|title=Radiación natural y artificial|format=Web|author=Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear|editor=[[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio de España]]|access-date=24 February 2016|language=Spanish}}</ref>

The most frequent radionuclides in soils are naturally [[radium-226]] (<sup>226</sup>Ra), [[radon-222]] (<sup>222</sup>Rn), [[thorium-232]] (<sup>232</sup>Th), [[uranium-238]] (<sup>238</sup>U) and [[potassium-40]] (<sup>40</sup>K). Potassium-40 (up to 88% of total activity), [[carbon-14]] (<sup>14</sup>C), [[radium-226]], [[uranium-238]] and [[rubidium-87]] (<sup>87</sup>Rb) are found in [[ocean]] waters.

The classification of radioactive waste established by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) distinguishes six levels according to [[equivalent dose]], [[specific activity]], [[heat]] released and [[half-life]] of the radionuclides:<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1419_web.pdf|title=Classification of radioactive waste: general safety guide|issue=nº GSG–1|author=Vienna International Centre|journal=IAEA Safety Standards Series|issn=1020-525X|isbn=9789201092090|publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]|place=Viena|year=2009|pages=5–6}}</ref>

*'''Exempt waste (EW)''': Waste that meets the criteria for exclusion from regulatory control for radiation protection purposes.
*'''Very short lived waste (VSLW)''': Waste with very short half-lives (often used for research and medical purposes) that can be stored over a limited period of up to a few years and subsequently cleared from regulatory control.
*'''Very low level waste (VLLW)''': Waste like soil and [[rubble]] (with low levels of activity concentration) that may also contain other hazardous waste.
*'''Low level waste (LLW)''': Waste that is above clearance levels and requires robust isolation and containment for periods of up to a few hundred years and is suitable for disposal in engineered near surface facilities. LLW include short lived radionuclides at higher levels of activity concentration and also long lived radionuclides, but only at relatively low levels of activity concentration.
*'''Intermediate level waste (ILW)''': Waste with long lived radionuclides that requires a greater degree of containment and isolation at greater depths.
*'''High level waste (HLW)''': Waste with large amounts of long lived radionuclides that need to be stored in deep, stable [[geological formations]] usually several hundred metres or more below the surface.

=== Ecological and human health consequences ===
Radioactive contamination is a potential danger for living organisms and results in external hazards, concerning radiation sources outside the body, and internal dangers, as a result of the incorporation of radionuclides inside the body (often by [[inhalation]] of particles or [[ingestion]] of [[contaminated food]]).<ref name="chemistry">{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WE7DeP21BhcC&q=biological+effects+of+radioactive+pollution&pg=PP16|title=Environmental Chemistry|chapter=Effects of radioactive pollution|isbn=9788182830127|editor1-first=B.K|editor1-last=Sharma|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|place=Meerut|year=2007|first1=B.K|last1=Sharma|first2=A|last2=Sharma|first3=M|last3=Sharma|chapter-format=Web}}</ref>

In humans, single doses from 0.25 [[Sievert|Sv]] produce first anomalies in the amount of [[leukocytes]]. This effect is accentuated if the [[absorbed dose]] is between 0.5 and 2 Sv, in whose first damage, [[nausea]] and [[hair loss]] are suffered. The strip ranging between 2 and 5 Sv is considered the most serious and include [[bleeding]], [[ulcers]] and risk of [[death]]; values exceeding 5 Sv involve immediate death.<ref name="chemistry"/> If radiation, likewise, is received in small doses over long periods of time, the consequences can be equally severe. It is difficult to quantify the health effects for doses below 10 [[mSv]], but it has been shown that there is a direct relationship between prolonged exposure and [[cancer]] risk (although there is not a very clear dose-response relationship to establish clear limits of exposure).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know|last1=Brenner|first1=D.J|last2=Doll|first2=R|first3=D.T|last3=Goodhead|first4=E.J|last4=Hall|first5=C.E|last5=Land|journal=PNAS|volume=100|issue=24|pages=13761–13766|doi=10.1073/pnas.2235592100|issn=1091-6490|year=2003|pmid=14610281|pmc=283495|bibcode=2003PNAS..10013761B}}</ref>

The information available on the effect of natural background radiation with respect anthropogenic pollution on [[wildlife]] is scarce and refers to very few species. It is very difficult to estimate from the available data the total doses that can accumulate during specific stages of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[embryonic development]] or reproductive age), in changes in [[behavior]] or depending on [[environmental factors]] such as [[seasonality]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/39102681720.pdf|title=Radiation & the environment: Assessing effects on animals and plants|first1=G|last1=Linsley|journal=IAEA Bulletin|year=1997}}</ref> The phenomena of radioactive [[bioaccumulation]], [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]], however, are especially known to sea level.

== Bacterial bioremediation ==
The biochemical transformation of radionuclides into stable isotopes by [[bacteria|bacterial species]] significantly differs from the metabolism of [[organic compounds]] coming from carbon sources. They are highly energetic radioactive forms which can be converted indirectly by the process of microbial [[energy transfer]].<ref name="nabir"/>

Radioisotopes can be transformed directly through changes in [[valence (chemistry)|valence state]] by acting as [[electron acceptor|acceptors]] or by acting as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] to [[enzymes]]. They can also be transformed indirectly by [[reducing agent|reducing]] and [[oxidizing agents]] produced by microorganisms that cause changes in [[pH]] or [[redox potential]]. Other processes include [[precipitation]] and complexation of [[surfactant]]s, or [[chelating agents]] that bind to radioactive elements. Human intervention, on the other hand, can improve these processes through [[genetic engineering]] and [[omics]], or by injection of microorganisms or [[nutrients]] into the treatment area.<ref name="nabir"/><ref name="brookhaven"/>

===Bioreduction===
{{main|Biotransformation}}
According to the radioactive element and the specific site conditions, bacteria can enzymatically immobilize radionuclides directly or indirectly. Their [[redox potential]] is exploited by some microbial species to carry out reductions that alter the [[solubility]] and hence, mobility, [[bioavailability]] and [[radiotoxicity]]. This waste treatment technique called bioreduction or enzymatic biotransformation is very attractive because it can be done in mild conditions for the environment, does not produce hazardous secondary waste and has potential as a solution for waste of various kinds.<ref name="in situ"/>

[[File:Enzymatic reduction of radionuclides (en).png|thumb|460px|right|Depiction of direct enzymatic reduction. Microorganisms use organic compounds as [[Lactic acid|lactate]], [[acetate]] or [[formate]] as [[electron donors]] to reduce and leave radionuclides in insoluble form.<ref name="prakash"/>]]

Direct enzymatic reduction is the change of radionuclides of a higher oxidation state to a lower one made by [[facultative anaerobe|facultative]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]s. The radioisotope interact with binding sites of metabolically active cells and is used as [[terminal electron acceptor]] in the [[electron transport chain]] where compounds such as [[ethyl lactate]] act as [[electron donors]] under [[anaerobic respiration]].<ref name="in situ"/>

The [[periplasm]] plays a very important role in these bioreductions. In the reduction of [[uranium]] (VI) to insoluble uranium (IV), made by ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio vulgaris]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'', the activity of periplasmic [[cytochromes]] is required. The reduction of [[technetium]] (VII) to technetium (IV) made by ''S. putrefaciens'', ''G. sulfurreducens'', ''D. desulfuricans'', ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', on the other hand, requires the presence of the complex [[formate hydrogenlyase]], also placed in this cell compartment.<ref name="prakash"/>

Other radioactive [[actinides]] such as [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], [[neptunium]] and [[americium]] are enzymatically reduced by ''[[Rhodoferax ferrireducens]]'', ''S. putrefaciens'' and several species of ''[[Geobacter]]'', and directly form an insoluble [[mineral]] phase.<ref name="prakash"/>

The phenomenon of indirect enzymatic reduction is carried out by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] and [[dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria]] on [[excretion]] reactions of [[metabolites]] and breakdown products. There is a coupling of the [[oxidation]] of [[organic acids]] —produced by the excretion of these [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic bacteria]]— with the reduction of [[iron]] or other [[metals]] and radionuclides, which forms insoluble compounds that can precipitate as [[oxide minerals|oxide]] and [[oxide minerals|hydroxide minerals]]. In the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is produced, promoting increased solubility of polluting radionuclides and their [[bioleaching]] (as liquid waste that can then be recovered).<ref name="prakash"/><ref name="in situ"/>

There are several species of reducing microorganisms that produce indirect [[sequestering agents]] and specific [[chelation|chelators]], such as [[siderophores]]. These sequestering agents are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. ''[[Microbacterium|Microbacterium flavescens]]'', for example, grows in the presence of radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that [[enterobactin]] siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.<ref name="prakash"/><ref name="in situ"/>

==== Citrate complexes ====
[[Citrate]] is a chelator which binds to certain [[transition metals]] and radioactive actinides. Stable complexes such as [[denticity|bidentate]], [[denticity|tridentate]] (ligands with more than one atom bound) and polynuclear complexes (with several radioactive atoms) can be formed with citrate and radionuclides, which receive a microbial action. Anaerobically, ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and species of the genera ''[[Shewanella]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' are able to reduce bidentate complexes of [[uranyl-citrate]] (VI) to uranyl-citrate (IV) and make them precipitate, despite not being able to degrade metabolically complexed citrate at the end of the process.<ref name="prakash"/> In denitrifying and aerobic conditions, however, it has been determined that it is not possible to reduce or degrade these uranium complexes. Bioreduction do not get a head when they are citrate complex mixed metal complexes or when they are tridentate, monomeric or polynuclear complexes, since they become [[recalcitrant]] and persistent in the environment.<ref name="in situ"/><ref>{{cite book|chapter=6.

=== Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization ===
[[File:Biosorption, biomineralization and bioaccumulation of radionuclides (en).png|500px|right|thumb| Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization strategies with a specific role for each cell compartment.<ref name="newsome"/>]]
{{main|Biosorption|Bioaccumulation|Biomineralization}}
The set of strategies that comprise biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization are closely related to each other, because one way or another have a direct contact between the cell and radionuclide. These mechanisms are evaluated accurately using advanced analysis technologies such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]] and [[XANES]], [[EXAFS]] and [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectroscopies]].<ref name="nabir"/><ref name="phosphate">{{cite journal|title=Phosphate-Mediated Remediation of Metals and Radionuclides|year=2014|journal=Advances in Ecology|doi=10.1155/2014/786929|first1=R.J|last1=Martinez|first2=M.J|last2=Beazley|first3=P.A|last3=Sobecky|volume=2014|pages=1–14|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Biosorption and bioaccumulation are two metabolic actions that are based on the ability to concentrate radionuclides over a thousand times the concentration of the environment. They consist of complexation of radioactive waste with [[phosphates]], organic compounds and [[sulfites]] so that they become insoluble and less exposed to radiotoxicity. They are particularly useful in [[biosolids]] for [[agricultural]] purposes and [[soil amendments]], although most properties of these biosolids are unknown.<ref name="developments">{{cite journal|title=Developments in bioremediation of soils and sediments polluted with metals and radionuclides: 2. Field research on bioremediation of metals and radionuclides|last1=Hazen|first1=T.C|last2=Tabak H.H|year=2005|journal=Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology|volume=4|issue=3|pages=157–183|doi=10.1007/s11157-005-2170-y|s2cid=129843161|issn=1572-9826|url = https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc893696/}}</ref>

Biosorption method is based on passive sequestration of positively charged radioisotopes by [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS) on the [[cell membrane]] (negatively charged), either live or dead bacteria. Its efficiency is directly related to the increase in temperature and can last for hours, being a much faster method than direct bioreduction. It occurs through the formation of [[biofilm|slimes]] and capsules, and with a preference for binding to the [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoryl]] groups (although it also occurs with [[carboxyl]], [[amine]] or [[sulfhydryl]] groups). ''[[Firmicutes]]'' and other bacteria like ''[[Citrobacter freudii]]'' have significant biosorption capabilities; ''[[Citrobacter]]'' does it through [[electrostatic interaction]] of uranium with phosphates of their LPS.<ref name="prakash"/><ref name="newsome"/>

Quantitative analyzes determine that, in the case of uranium, biosorption may vary within a range between 45 and 615 [[milligrams]] per gram of cell [[dry weight]]. However, it is a technique that requires a high amount of biomass to affect bioremediation; it presents problems of [[binding site|saturation]] and other cations that compete for binding to the bacterial surface.<ref name="newsome"/>

Bioaccumulation refers to uptake of radionuclides into the cell, where they are retained by complexations with negatively charged intracellular components, precipitation or [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] formations. Unlike biosorption, this is an [[Active transport|active process]]: it depends on an energy-dependent transport system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}  Some metals or radionuclides can be absorbed by bacteria accidentally because of its resemblance to [[dietary elements]] for [[metabolic pathways]]. Several radioisotopes of [[strontium]], for example, are recognized as analogs of [[calcium]] and incorporated within ''[[Micrococcus luteus]]''.<ref name="in situ"/> [[Uranium]], however, has no known function and is believed that its entry into the cell interior may be due to its toxicity (it is able to increase [[membrane permeability]]).<ref name="newsome"/>
[[File:Chernikovite 1.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Chernikovite]] and [[meta-autunite]], radioactive minerals result of possible biomineralization.]]
Furthermore, biomineralization —also known as bioprecipitation— is the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of radionuclides through the generation of microbial ligands, resulting in the formation of stable [[Biogenic substance|biogenic minerals]]. These minerals have a very important role in the retention of radioactive contaminants. A very localized and produced enzymatically ligand concentration is involved and provides a [[nucleation site]] for the onset of biomineral precipitation.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=2.3 Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation|page=178|title=Radionuclides in the Environment: Influence of chemical speciation and plant uptake on radionuclide migration|first1=C|last1=Walther|first2=D.K|last2=Guptha|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319221717|place=Switzerland|chapter-format=Web|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7_YCgAAQBAJ&q=2.3+Biomineralization%2FBioprecipitation&pg=PA178}}</ref> This is particularly relevant in precipitations of [[phosphatase]] activity-derivate biominerals, which cleavage molecules such as [[glycerol phosphate]] on [[periplasm]]. In ''[[Citrobacter]]'' and ''[[Serratia]]'' genera, this cleavage liberates inorganic phosphates (HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) that precipitates with uranyl ion (UO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup>) and cause deposition of [[Crystallite|polycrystalline minerals]] around the cell wall.<ref name="prakash"/><ref>{{cite book|chapter=24.

Investigations of terrestrial and marine bacterial isolates belonging to the genera ''[[Aeromonas]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Myxococcus]]'', ''[[Pantoea]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rahnella]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' have also demonstrated the removal of uranium radioisotopes as phosphate biominerals in both [[oxygen|oxic]] and [[oxygen|anoxic]] growth conditions.<ref name="phosphate"/>

=== Biostimulation and bioaugmentation ===
{{main|Biostimulation|Bioaugmentation}}
[[File:Evolution of the Old Rifle Processing Site.jpeg|thumb|280px|right|Evolution of the Old Rifle [[Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action|UMTRA]] Site ([[Colorado]], [[US]]) from 1957 (above) until 2008 (below), in which biostimulation tasks were carried out.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/1895/|format=Web|title=In Situ Biostimulation of Uranium Reducing Microorganisms at the Old Rifle UMTRA Site|journal=Doctoral Dissertations|first1=Y|last1=Chang|year=2005|place=Knoxville}}</ref>]]
Aside from bioreduction, biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization, which are bacterial strategies for natural attenuation of radioactive contamination, there are also human methods that increase the efficiency or speed of microbial processes. This accelerated natural attenuation involves an intervention in the contaminated area to improve conversion rates of radioactive waste, which tend to be slow. There are two variants: biostimulation and bioaugmentation.<ref name="nabir goals">{{cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/NABIRarchive/researchprogram/strategicplan/goals.html|title=II. Program Goals and Management Strategy|format=Web|author=Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research|editor=[[United States Department of Energy]]|access-date=14 May 2015}}</ref>

Biostimulation is the addition of nutrients with [[trace elements]], [[electron donors]] or [[electron acceptors]] to stimulate activity and growth of natural [[indigenous microbial]] communities.<ref name="in situ"/><ref name="nabir goals"/> It can range from simple [[fertilization]] or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] sites.<ref name="developments"/> [[Nitrate]] is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of [[uranium]], because it serves as very energetically favorable [[electron acceptor]] for [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|metal-reducing bacteria]]. However, many of these microorganisms (''[[Geobacter]]'', ''[[Shewanella]]'' or ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'') exhibit [[R gene|resistance genes]] to [[heavy metals]] that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as [[ethanol]] is added to the medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of [[uranium]]. Ethanol is also used in soil injection systems with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|recirculations]]: it raises the [[pH]] and promotes the growth of [[denitrifying bacteria|denitrifying]] and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce [[biofilms]] and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.<ref name="prakash"/>

A number of [[geophysics|geophysical]] techniques have been used to monitor the effects of in situ biostimulation trials including measurement of: [[spectral ionization potential]], [[self potential]]s, [[current density]], [[complex resistivity]] and also [[reactive transport modelling]] (RTM), which measures [[hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] and [[geochemistry|geochemical]] parameters to estimate chemical reactions of the microbial community.<ref name="newsome"/>

Bioaugmentaton, on the other hand, is the deliberated addition to the environment of microorganisms with desired traits to accelerate bacterial metabolic conversion of radioactive waste. They are often added when necessary species for bioremediation do not exist in the treatment place.<ref name="in situ"/><ref name="nabir goals"/> This technique has shown in field trials over the years that it does not offer better results than biostimulation; neither it is clear that introduced species can be distributed effectively through the complex geological structures of most [[subsurface]] environments or that can compete long term with the indigenous microbiota.<ref name="nabir"/><ref name="developments"/>

=== Genetic engineering and omics ===
[[File:Deinococcus radiodurans.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' has much interest in [[genetic engineering]] for bioremediation of radioactive waste.]]
{{main|Genetic engineering|Omics}}
Omics, especially genomics and proteomics, allow identifying and evaluating [[genes]], [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] involved in radionuclide bioremediation, apart from the structural and functional interactions that exist between them and other metabolites. [[Genome sequencing]] of various microorganisms has uncovered, for example, that ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'' possess more than 100  [[coding region]]s for [[Cytochrome c|c-type cytochromes]] involved in bioremediation radionuclide, or that ''NiCoT'' gene is significantly overexpressed in ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]]'' and ''[[Novosphingobium aromaticivorans]]'' when grown in medium with radioactive [[cobalt]].<ref name="nabir"/><ref name="prakash"/>

From this information, different genetic engineering and [[recombinant DNA]] techniques are being developed to generate specific bacteria for bioremediation. Some [[DNA construct|constructs]] expressed in microbial species are [[phytochelatins]], [[histidine|polyhistidines]] and other [[polypeptides]] by [[Fusion protein|fusion-binding domains]] to outer-membrane-anchored proteins.<ref name="prakash"/> Some of these genetically modified strains are derived from ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', one of the most radiation-resistant organisms. ''D. radiodurans'' is capable to resist [[oxidative stress]] and [[DNA damage]] from radiation, and reduces [[technetium]], [[uranium]] and [[chromium]] naturally as well. Besides, through insertion of genes from other species it has been achieved that it can also precipitates [[uranyl phosphates]] and degrades [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] by using [[toluene]] as an energy source to grow and stabilize other priority radionuclides.<ref name="nabir"/><ref name="newsome"/>

[[Directed evolution]] of bacterial proteins related to bioremediation of radionuclides is also a field research. [[YieF]] enzyme, for example, naturally catalyzes the reduction of [[chromium]] with a very wide range of [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. Following [[protein engineering]], however, it has also been able to participate in [[uranyl ion]] reduction.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=A.C|last1=Matin|title=Development of combinatorial bacteria for metal and radionuclide bioremediation|editor=Stanford University|publisher= DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information|year=2006|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/883649|format=PDF|place=Stanford|doi=10.2172/883649}}</ref>

== Plant bioremediation ==
{{main|Phytoremediation}}
[[File:Phytoremediation Process.svg|thumb|right|380px|Phytoremediation processes. Radionuclides can not be phytodegraded but converted to more stable or less toxic forms.]]
The use of plants to remove contaminants from the environment or to render them less harmful is called phytoremediation. In the case of radionuclides, it is a viable technology when decontamination times are long and waste are scattered at low concentrations.<ref name="shaw">{{cite book|chapter=Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with radionuclides|pages=43–69|title=Radioactivity in the Terrestrial Environment|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Shaw|first1=N|last1=Willey|first2=C|last2=Collins|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080474892|volume=10|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(06)10003-0}}</ref><ref name="trends">{{cite journal|title=Trends in phytoremediation of radionuclides|year=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1022527207359|issn=1573-5036|first1=S|last1=Dushenkov|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=249|issue=1|pages=167–175|s2cid=43065577|place=Netherlands}}</ref>

Some plant species are able to transform the state of radioisotopes (without suffering toxicity) concentrating them in different parts of their structure, making them rush through the roots, making them volatile or stabilizing them on the ground. As in bacteria, plant [[genetic engineering]] procedures and biostimulation —called [[phytostimulation]]— have improved and accelerate these processes, particularly with regard to [[fast-growing plants]].<ref name="trends"/> The use of ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]'', for example, is quite widespread and significantly increases radionuclide uptake by the [[root]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

===Phytoextraction===
{{main|Phytoextraction}}
In phytoextraction (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption)<ref name="kumar">{{cite book|chapter=4. Phytoremediation techniques|pages=9–14|editor1-first=D|editor1-last=Kumar|editor2-first=C|editor2-last=Walther|place=Hannover|year=2014|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz4qBAAAQBAJ&q=Kumar%2C+D%3B+Walther%2C+C.+%C2%AB4.+Phytoremediation+techniques%C2%BB.+A%3A+Radionuclide+Contamination+and+Remediation+Through+Plants&pg=PA161|title=Radionuclide Contamination and Remediation Through Plants|isbn=9783319076652|publisher=Springer}}</ref> plants carry radioactive waste from the [[root system]] to the [[vascular tissue]] and become concentrated in the [[biomass]] of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on [[soil fertility]] and valid for large areas with a low level of radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through [[bioaccumulation coefficient]] (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per [[square metre|m<sup>2</sup>]], and is proven to attract [[cesium-137]], [[strontium-90]], [[technetium-99]], [[cerium-144]], [[plutonium-240]], [[americium-241]], [[neptunium-237]] and various radioisotopes of [[thorium]] and [[radium]].<ref name="trends"/> By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

Species like [[common heather]] or [[amaranths]] are able to concentrate cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]. In this region of [[Ukraine]], [[mustard greens]] could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way, [[bok choy]] and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more [[uranium]] than other species.<ref name="trends"/>

===Rhizofiltration===
[[File:Reedbeds - geograph.org.uk - 380204.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Connected pond system at [[River Dearne]] ([[England]]).]]
{{main|Rhizofiltration}}
Rhizofiltration is the adsorption and precipitation of radionuclides in plant roots or absorption thereof if soluble in effluents. It has great efficiency in the treatment of [[cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], particularly by [[algae]] and [[aquatic plants]], such as ''[[Cladophora]]'' and ''[[Elodea]]'' genera, respectively. It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in [[wetlands]],<ref name="kumar"/> but must have a continuous and rigorous control of [[pH]] to make it an optimal process.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

From this process, some strategies have been designed based on sequences of [[ponds]] with a slow [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of water to clean polluted water with radionuclides. The results of these facilities, for flows of 1000 liters of effluent are about 95% retention of radiation in the first pond (by plants and [[sludge]]), and over 99% in three-base systems.<ref name="trends"/>

The most promising plants for rhizofiltration are [[sunflowers]]. They are able to remove up to 95% of [[uranium]] of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in [[Chernobyl]] have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55&nbsp;kg of plant [[dry weight]] all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m<sup>2</sup> (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).<ref name="trends"/>

===Phytovolatilization===
{{main|Phytovolatilization}}
Phytovolatilization involves the capture and subsequent [[transpiration]] of radionuclides into the [[atmosphere]]. It does not remove contaminants but releases them in volatile form (less harmful). Despite not having too many applications for radioactive waste, it is very useful for the treatment of [[tritium]], because it exploits plants' ability to transpire enormous amounts of water.<ref name="trends"/><ref name="kumar"/>

The treatment applied to tritium (shielded by air produces almost no external radiation exposure, but its incorporation in water presents a health hazard when absorbed into the body) uses polluted effluents to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[phreatophyte]]s. It becomes a system with a low operation cost and low maintenance, with savings of about 30% in comparison to conventional methods of [[pumping (oil well)|pumping]] and covering with [[asphalt]].<ref name="trends"/>

===Phytostabilization===
{{main|Phytostabilization}}
Phytostabilization is an specially valid strategy for radioactive contamination based on the immobilization of radionuclides in the soil by the action of the roots. This can occur by adsorption, absorption and precipitation within root zone, and ensures that radioactive waste can not be dispersed because [[soil erosion]] or [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]]. It is useful in controlling tailings from strip and open pit uranium mines, and guarantees to retrieve the [[ecosystem]].<ref name="trends"/><ref name="kumar"/> However, it has significant drawbacks such as large doses of [[fertilizer]] needed to reforest the area, apart from radioactive source (which implies long-term maintenance) remaining at the same place.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}

== Fungal bioremediation ==
[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Radiotrophic fungi]] growth has been described in reactor 4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]].]]
{{main|Mycoremediation}}
Several fungi species have radioactive resistance values equal to or greater than more radioresistant bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating [[spores]] and decomposing pieces of [[graphite]] from destroyed [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|reactor No. 4]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]], which is contaminated with high concentrations of [[cesium]], [[plutonium]] and [[cobalt]] radionuclides. They were called [[radiotrophic fungi]].<ref name="casadevall">{{cite journal|first1=E|last1=Dadachova|first2=A|last2=Casadevall|title=Ionizing Radiation: how fungi cope, adapt, and exploit with the help of melanin|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=2008|volume=11|issue=6|pages=525–531|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.09.013|pmc=2677413|pmid=18848901}}</ref>

Since then, it has been shown that some species of ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' and ''[[Xerocomus]]'' are able to use [[ionizing radiation]] as energy through the electronic properties of [[melanins]].<ref name="casadevall"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=A review of edible mushroom radioactivity|first1=P|last1=Kalac|journal=Food Chemistry|year=2001|volume=75|issue=1|pages=29–35|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00171-6}}</ref> In their feeding they bioaccumulate radioisotopes, creating problems on [[concrete]] walls of [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]].<ref>{{cite book|pages=236–266|chapter=Fungal dissolution and transformation of minerals: significance for nutrient and metal mobility|first1=M|last1=Fomina|first2=E.P|last2=Burford|first3=G|last3=M.

== Ways of research ==
Current research on bioremediation techniques is fairly advanced and molecular mechanisms that govern them are well known. There are, however, many doubts about the effectiveness and possible adversities of these processes in combination with the addition of [[agrochemicals]]. In soils, the role of [[mycorrhizae]] on radioactive waste is poorly described and sequestration patterns of radionuclides are not known with certainty.<ref name="pergamon">{{cite journal|title=Soil contamination with radionuclides and potential remediation|first1=Y.G|last1=Zhu|first2=G|last2=Shaw|journal=Chemosphere|volume=41|year=2000|issue=1–2|doi=10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00398-7|pmid=10819188|pages=121–128|bibcode=2000Chmsp..41..121Z}}</ref>

Longevity effects of some bacterial processes, such as maintenance of uranium in insoluble form because of bioreductions or biomineralizations, are unknown. There are not clear details about the [[electronic transfer]] from some radionuclides with these bacterial species either.<ref name="newsome"/>

Another important aspect is the change of ''[[ex situ]]'' or laboratory scale processes to their real application ''[[in situ]]'', in which soil heterogeneity and environmental conditions generate reproduction deficiencies of optimal biochemical status of the used species, a fact that decreases the efficiency. This implies finding what are the best conditions in which to carry out an efficient bioremediation with anions, metals, organic compounds or other chelating radionuclides that can compete with the uptake of interest radioactive waste.<ref name="prakash"/> Nevertheless, in many cases research is focused on the extraction of soil and water and its ''ex situ'' biological treatment to avoid these problems.<ref name="in situ"/>

Finally, the potential of [[GMOs]] is limited by [[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms|regulatory agencies]] in terms of [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and [[bioethics|bioethical]] issues. Their release require support on the action zone and comparability with indigenous species. Multidisciplinary research is focused on defining more precisely necessary [[genes]] and [[proteins]] to establish new [[free-cell]] systems, which may avoid possible side effects on the environment by the intrusion of [[transgenic]] or [[invasive species]].<ref name="prakash"/>
