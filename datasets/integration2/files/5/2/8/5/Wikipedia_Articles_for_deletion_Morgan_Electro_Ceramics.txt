*'''Merge''' to [[Morgan Advanced Materials]] ~[[User:Kvng|Kvng]] ([[User talk:Kvng|talk]]) 14:27, 23 May 2016 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' and then redirect as this is basically their own website with the products listed and such, therefore not acceptable at all, my searches have found only a few links so there's simply nothing actually suggestive of keeping it, altogether or saved as a history.

*'''Comment''' – I considered the notion of merging, but the article has no sources or inline citations, just external links to official websites. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[User:Northamerica1000|North America]]<sup>[[User talk:Northamerica1000|<font size="-2">1000</font>]]</sup></span> 21:02, 27 May 2016 (UTC)
::Why is uncited material not a candidate for merging? You're not the first I'm hearing this from. It isn't mentioned at [[WP:MERGE]]. I haven't heard of this before so either it is a new thing or something specific to deletion discussions. Where does this come from? ~[[User:Kvng|Kvng]] ([[User talk:Kvng|talk]]) 22:23, 27 May 2016 (UTC)
:::A blanket merge of entirely unsourced content essentially goes against the grain of [[WP:V]]. However, if the content is able to be sourced (and if this were to actually occur), I would be willing to change my !vote to a merge. <span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;">[[User:Northamerica1000|North America]]<sup>[[User talk:Northamerica1000|<font size="-2">1000</font>]]</sup></span> 22:40, 27 May 2016 (UTC)
::::Per [[WP:V]], sourcing is required for challenged material or material likely to be challenged. The notability of the material here has been challenged in the AFD, but not the material itself. I realize that this article is not a particularly good example but I frequently see material blanked and redirected with ''unsourced'' as the justification and it doesn't always make sense to me. ~[[User:Kvng|Kvng]] ([[User talk:Kvng|talk]]) 02:27, 28 May 2016 (UTC)
