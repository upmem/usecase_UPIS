[[WP:NSONGS|Non-notable songs]] fails any ounce of third party notability.

:'''<s>Delete</s>Redirect''' - NSONG states charting will "suggest that a song or single ''may'' be notable", it is clear that there is really nothing sourced to say about this song that cannot fit into the parent article. - <span style="color:#D70270;background-color:white;">Sum</span><span style="color:#734F96;background-color:white;">mer</span><span style="color:#0038A8;background-color:white;">PhD</span><sup>[[User talk:SummerPhDv2.0|v2.0]]</sup> 14:33, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
::I have created a new chart at [[Christmas Kisses (EP)]] reflecting the charting. (I did not copy the chart.

*'''Speedy keep'''. Nomination proposes merging some content to another article. This is incompatible with deletion. --[[User:Michig|Michig]] ([[User talk:Michig|talk]]) 06:50, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
::I assume you are referring to [[WP:SPEEDYKEEP]] #1 and believe this is really a merge request. However, "and no one other than the nominator recommends that the page be deleted" applies. Yes, you could argue that this ''should'' be a merge request. No one would see it. Feel free to copy that chart info over, then there is nothing to merge. "Problem" solved. - <span style="color:#D70270;background-color:white;">Sum</span><span style="color:#734F96;background-color:white;">mer</span><span style="color:#0038A8;background-color:white;">PhD</span><sup>[[User talk:SummerPhDv2.0|v2.0]]</sup> 19:50, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
:::If, as the nomination appears to advocate, that chart info was copied over there we would need to redirect to preserve attribution, so this discussion could not be closed as delete, i.e. it's the wrong forum. The nominator could just have done the merge, redirected, and saved having this discussion. --[[User:Michig|Michig]] ([[User talk:Michig|talk]]) 20:21, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
::::Good lord, read again. I'm clearly saying to delete this because it fails WP:NSONGS. Along with it I mentioned that the chart placement can be included in the discogaphy page. Nowhere I asked to have it be redirected. —[[User:IndianBio|<font size="2" face="Courier New" color="#6F00FF"><b>I</b><font color="#FF033E">'''B'''</font></font>]] <sup>[ [[User talk:IndianBio|<font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#1C1CF0"><b>Poke</b></font>]] ]</sup> 11:49, 22 May 2016 (UTC)

:::::Far be it from me to suggest that you've copied the content there and tidied it up, but if there is agreement that nothing is getting merged it would be better to delete as this title given that anyone searching for this song will end up at the disambiguation page [[Love Is Everything]], where the entry should be altered to link to the EP article. --[[User:Michig|Michig]] ([[User talk:Michig|talk]]) 15:59, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
::::::I won't stoop so low as to mention my opponent's drinking problem, but I went to the sources, created a new chart... then referred to the old one to clean up my crappy chart-fu. I'm stunned that anyone else came up with the novel idea that "love is everything".

*'''Keep''': This article can be improved by expanding its content. Some people think that it should be deleted simply because it's too empty. Actually, it doesn't fail [[WP:NSONG]]. Deletion or redirection is not the best and appropriate choice. [[user:U990467|U990467]] 16:07, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
::'''Comment''' "A standalone article is only appropriate when there is enough material to warrant a reasonably detailed article; articles unlikely ever to grow beyond stubs should be merged to articles about an artist or album."

:::User:U990467, you have no idea about [[WP:NSONGS]] based on your comment "Some people think that it should be deleted simply because it's too empty. Actually, it doesn't fail [[WP:NSONG]]" and I suggest you re-read it and try to understand. This article has no notability other than a minor chart placement. —[[User:IndianBio|<font size="2" face="Courier New" color="#6F00FF"><b>I</b><font color="#FF033E">'''B'''</font></font>]] <sup>[ [[User talk:IndianBio|<font face="Tempus Sans ITC" color="#1C1CF0"><b>Poke</b></font>]] ]</sup> 07:51, 23 May 2016 (UTC)
