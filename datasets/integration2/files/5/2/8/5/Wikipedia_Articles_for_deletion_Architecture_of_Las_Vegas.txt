Unencyclopedic, uninformative, unbalanced and written like a high-school essay.

*'''Keep''' - I think this is probably a worthy and interesting topic, and I can see their is at least one item published on it.... just needs to be re written, and (a Lot) more references [[User:Deathlibrarian|Deathlibrarian]] ([[User talk:Deathlibrarian|talk]]) 09:32, 20 May 2016 (UTC)

*'''Keep'''. Clearly a notable topic, and, as [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] has demonstrated, there is no need to delete an article before rewriting it, so the essay [[WP:TNT]] should never be cited as a reason for deletion.

*'''Response'''. I agree the topic is notable and deserves a killer article. So I guess my question is where we go from here? Could this AfD discussion informally endorse my blowing it up so that someone can start again? I think we all agree it's a terrible article but nobody has yet volunteered to fix it. It would be a shame if the only result of this discussion were 'oh well'. <font color="#cb7b40">'''Dubbin'''</font><sup>''[[User:Dubbin|u]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[User talk:Dubbin#top|t]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dubbin|c]]''</sup> 12:48, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
:*But [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]] already ''has'' blown it up and started again, and article deletion was not part of that process. [[Special:Contributions/86.17.222.157|86.17.222.157]] ([[User talk:86.17.222.157|talk]]) 13:02, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
::* Oh! I hadn't seen that that had happened. My watchlist only highlighted up a more recent minor edit. Props to [[User:Uncle G|Uncle G]]. In that case, '''keep'''. <font color="#cb7b40">'''Dubbin'''</font><sup>''[[User:Dubbin|u]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[User talk:Dubbin#top|t]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Dubbin|c]]''</sup> 18:25, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
:::*That means that this discussion can be closed now as withdrawn with no outstanding "delete" opinions, which is the best possible result of an AfD discussion, being a very rare case of such a discussion where people actually take note of what others have said rather than get into entrenched positions. I don't know how to do that myself and am too busy cooking dinner to spend the time looking it up now, so maybe someone who does know how could close this?
