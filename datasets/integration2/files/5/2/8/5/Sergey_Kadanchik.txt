The landing began on 9 September. Before reaching the shore, Kadanchik's boat sank after it hit a mine. He was rescued by a ship returning to [[Gelendzhik]]. Kadanchik arrived on the beachhead before the evening. Lieutenant General [[Ivan Yefimovich Petrov|Ivan  Petrov]], commander of the [[North Caucasian Front]], concluded that a breakthrough in the German line would be most likely to succeed in the sector assigned to Kadanchik's regiment. During the second half of 10 September the Germans brought up reinforcements, launching seven counterattacks. These were repulsed but by the evening some elements of the regiment had been pushed back to the sea. During the night German attacks forced the regiment back to the coast and it became surrounded.
