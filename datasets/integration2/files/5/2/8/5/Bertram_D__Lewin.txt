'''Bertram David Lewin''' (1896-1971) was an American [[psychoanalyst]] who was both an acute clinician and a contributor to theory, particularly to the study of [[Hypermania|elation]], and of the dream screen.

==Training and contributions==
Lewin had a training analysis with [[Franz Alexander]] in Berlin in the 1920s, before publishing his first analytic article in 1930.  This was followed by ten more over the next decade, on subjects ranging from diabetes and [[claustrophobia]] to the body as [[phallus]].<ref>[[Otto Fenichel]], ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 636</ref>  The main focus of his interest, however, was in manic states, which he saw as characterised by fleeting identifications with a multiple of outside figures.<ref>Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 408</ref>

After the war, he published the fruits of his investigations in ''The Psychoanalysis of Elation'' (1951).  There he stressed the role of [[denial]] in mania – denial particularly of feelings of separation and loss.<ref>S. M. Skubal, ''Word of Mouth'' (2013) p. 35-6</ref>  He also explored the paradox in elation's dark counterpart, depression, whereby the melancholic in seeking to punish the effigy of their loved one in fact punishes themselves having incorporated this effigy.<ref>[[Darian Leader]], ''The New Black'' (2008) p. 55</ref>

By that point he had also published his seminal article (1946) on the dream screen – the backcloth formed from primitive memories of the breast onto which the dream is projected.<ref>L. Fischer, ''Shot/Countershot'' (2014) p. 78</ref>  The concept would be fruitfully followed up both within analysis,<ref>J. Pearson, ''Analyst of the Imagination'' (2004) p. 62</ref> and in the context of [[film theory]].<ref>L. Fischer, ''Cinematernity'' (2014) p. 25</ref>
