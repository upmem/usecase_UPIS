{{main|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy}}
The publication of [[editorial cartoon|satirical cartoons]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] in the Danish newspaper ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' on September 30, 2005 led to violence, arrests, inter-governmental tensions, and debate about the scope of free speech and the place of Muslims in the West. Many Muslims stress that image of Muhammad is [[blasphemy|blasphemous]], while many Westerners have defended the right of [[free speech]]. A number of governments, organizations, and individuals have issued statements defining their stance on the protests or cartoons. This article details the reactions of international organisations and countries, as well as detailing events surrounding the publication. For the opinions of individuals and other organisations please see [[Opinions on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]. For a detailed, chronological account of the controversy please see [[Timeline of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].

====United Nations====

On February 13, 2006 [[Doudou Diène]], [[UN]] Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reported:<ref>[http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/dpage_e.aspx?m=92 E/CN.4/2006/17], ''United Nations'', February 13, 2006, ap.ohchr.org</ref>

<blockquote>Legally, the Government of every State party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is bound by three articles dealing with the relationship between freedom of religion and freedom of opinion and expression, namely article 18, which protects freedom of religion, subject to such limitations as are necessary to protect public safety and order or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others (art. 18, para. 3); article 19, which protects freedom of expression and opinion, subject to certain restrictions such as "respect of the rights or reputations of others" (art. 19, para. 3 (a)); and article 20, which states that any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law.</blockquote>

* After being asked to do so by the Secretary-General of the [[Arab League]] [[Amr Mussa]], the [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]], asked the [[West]]ern media to be more sensitive in its handling of religious themes and asked for use of peaceful dialogue.<ref>{{in lang|de}} "Tage des Zorns," 2006-02-06 ''[[Der Spiegel]]''</ref>

====European Union====
[[José Manuel Barroso]], the President of the [[European Commission]],  supported the Danish government saying that freedom of speech cannot be compromised: "It's better to publish too much than not to have freedom.."<ref>{{cite web|date=January 30, 2006|title=Cartoon Protesters Rampage in Pakistan|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060214/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawings;_ylt=A86.I0r0UfJDWnoAxRlvaA8F;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222225948/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060214/ap_on_re_mi_ea/prophet_drawings|archivedate=February 22, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Franco Frattini]], the vice-President of the [[European Commission]] and EU Commissioner for Justice, Freedom, and Security, called the publication of the twelve cartoons "thoughtless and inappropriate" in a time when European animosity towards Islam is said to be on the rise. According to Frattini, the cartoons foment hostility against Islam and foreigners.

The European Union on 2006-01-30, said that any retaliatory boycott of Danish goods would violate world trade rules.<ref>{{cite news|first=Constant |last=Brand |date=January 30, 2006 |title=EU Backs Denmark in caricature dispute |work=BusinessWeek |url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FF4R0O0.htm?campaign_id=apn_home_down&chan=db |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126223607/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8FF4R0O0.htm?campaign_id=apn_home_down&chan=db |archivedate=January 26, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

On February 15, 2006, the [[European Parliament]] accepted a resolution which condemns all violence arising from the publication of the cartoons. It stated that the EU stands in solidarity with Denmark and all other countries that have been affected by the violence. Furthermore, it stated that [[Muslim]]s may be offended by the cartoons and that they have the right to protest peacefully. However the freedom of speech is absolute and may not be affected by any form of censorship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Europa veroordeelt het cartoongeweld (Dutch)|url=http://www.vrtnieuws.net/nieuwsnet_master/versie2/nieuws/details/060215EuropaCartoons/index.shtml|publisher=Belga|date=February 16, 2006}}</ref>

====Organisation of the Islamic Conference====
The OIC member states held a meeting<ref>{{cite news|title=Statement of the OIC Ambassadorial Extraordinary Plenary Meeting |publisher=Organization of the Islamic Conference |date=February 14, 2006 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/February%202006/joint-statment.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305070505/http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/February%202006/joint-statment.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 5, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> in [[Jeddah]] on February 14, 2006, to discuss the publication of the cartoons. The ambassadors felt that the reaction of the Danish authorities on the issue was "''under par''" compared to the reaction of other European states which condemned the publication of the cartoons and considered it as a provocation and an incitement to hatred. The member states approved a five-point plan which the OIC Secretary General [[Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu]] had proposed to [[Javier Solana]] on February 7, 2006. The plan called for:
:# the European Union to adopt legislative measures against Islamophobia;
:# the OIC and the EU to work towards a [[United Nations Resolutions|UN Resolution]] on the lines of the existing UN Resolution 60/150 (Combating defamation of religions) which should prohibit defamation of all prophets and faiths;
:# the European media to adopt a code of ethics;
:# the United Nations to adopt an International Communication Media Order covering a definition of freedom of speech in case of religious symbols;
:# the inclusion of a paragraph prohibiting blasphemy, defamation of religions and incitement to hatred in the text of the [[Human Rights Council]] resolution presently being negotiated.

Previously, on January 1, 2006, the OIC decided to boycott a project called "''Images of the Middle East''" which was to be organized by the Danish Center for Culture and Development and partially financed by the Danish Government. The press release<ref>{{cite news|title=Boycott of Danish project by the OIC |publisher=Organization of the Islamic Conference |date=January 28, 2006 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305064842/http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 5, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> mentions that the Third Extraordinary Session of the Islamic Summit Conference addressed this issue and stressed "''the responsibility of all governments to ensure full respect of all religions and religious symbols, stating that the freedom of expression does not justify in any way whatsoever the defamation of religions.''"

On January 28, 2006, the OIC Secretary General called for "''Muslims to stay calm and peaceful in the wake of sacrilegious depiction of Prophet Muhammad which has deeply hurt their feelings''".<ref>{{cite news|title=OIC Secretary General calls for calm amongst Muslims |publisher=Organization of the Islamic Conference |date=January 1, 2006 |url=http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark-3.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206021616/http://www.oic-oci.org/press/english/2006/January%202006/denemark-3.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 6, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

====Canada====
Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] issued a statement on February 14, 2006, that said Canadians have the right to free speech as well as the right to voice their opinions about the free speech of others. He said that he "regretted" that several Canadian newspapers had chosen to run the cartoons after the controversy began. "While we understand this issue is divisive, our government wishes that people be respectful of the beliefs of others." Harper also commended the Canadian Muslim community for voicing its opinion peacefully, respectfully and democratically.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harper defends free speech but regrets cartoons' publication |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=February 15, 2006 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/harper-defends-free-speech-but-regrets-cartoons-publication/article703329/ |location=Toronto |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115070759/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/harper-defends-free-speech-but-regrets-cartoons-publication/article703329/ |archivedate=November 15, 2016 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Foreign affairs minister [[Peter MacKay]] released a statement commenting that "This sensitive issue highlights the need for a better understanding of Islam and of Muslim communities... [to] promote a better understanding of Islam internationally, in partnership with Muslim communities."

====Czech Republic====
After Iran sent a formal strong objection to the Czech government against the publication of the cartoons in [[MF DNES]] and [[Hospodářské noviny]], the newspapers insisted that it was necessary for them to publish the pictures so that the readers get the full information. The Czech foreign minister Cyril Svoboda called the Muslim reaction "exaggerated" and advocated a united European stand on the issue.<ref>[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2006/February/middleeast_February334.xml&section=middleeast&col= Khaleejtimes.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514194355/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data%2Fmiddleeast%2F2006%2FFebruary%2Fmiddleeast_February334.xml&section=middleeast&col= |date=May 14, 2007 }}</ref> President [[Václav Klaus]] argued that freedom of speech is only meaningful as a contract between a citizen and a particular government. The Czech government expressed solidarity with Denmark.

====Egypt====
In December 2005, [[Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy]], the Grand [[Imam]] of [[Al-Azhar]] [[Mosque]] and Grand [[Sheikh]] of [[Al-Azhar University]], issued a statement saying that "Al-Azhar intends to protest these anti-Prophet cartoons with the UN's concerned committees and human rights groups around the world."<ref>[http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-12/11/article04.shtml Al-Azhar Takes Anti-Prophet Danish Cartoons to UN] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427034309/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2005-12/11/article04.shtml |date=April 27, 2006 }} - [[Islamonline.net]], December 11, 2005, islamonline.net</ref>

In early January the Egyptian government threatened Denmark with an [[embargo]] of [[List of Danish companies|Danish products]], but did not carry out its threat. Some citizens and major shops started a boycott on their own.

A poll of 1,000 Egyptians in October 2006 revealed that Denmark's image as an enemy to the Egyptian people remained in place.  60% of those polled viewed that Denmark was hostile to Egypt.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6107160.stm Denmark 'Egypt's foe', says poll] - [[BBC News]]. November 1, 2006, news.bbc.co.uk</ref>

====Finland====
In February, Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Erkki Tuomioja]] said that Denmark should have acted earlier and paid more attention to Muslim outrage over the offensive caricatures. He added that the Danish government could apologise for the fact that religious feelings were offended, without endangering freedom of expression.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135218601506 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-02-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211170313/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/1135218601506 |archivedate=February 11, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> The party of indigenous [[Islam in Finland|Finnish Muslims]], the [[Finnish Islamic Party]], said that it had issued a statement to the media that it condemns the republication of the caricatures and that "We also condemn the Danish government for not interfering in issues that causes confrontation between Islamic world and non-Islamic world. Reissuing the caricatures will cause widely spread agitation because things that Muslims hold sacred have been insulted. Therefore The Finnish Islamic Party exhorts to boikot Danish products everywhere." (verbatim)<ref>http://www.suomenislamilainenpuolue.fi/tiedotteetEN.html</ref>

Police opened investigations into the publication of the cartoons by [[Far-right-wing|far-right wing]] [[ultra nationalist]] ''[[Suomen Sisu]]'' group. In Finland it is illegal to "disturb religious peace" (literal translation). This law is rarely prosecuted, giving this incident nationwide attention. The cartoons have been published on numerous Finnish web sites but not in mainstream media. Police declined to comment which site or sites are being investigated, and said any media that publishes the cartoons will be similarly investigated.<ref>[http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135218760533 HS.fi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218005851/http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/1135218760533 |date=February 18, 2006 }}</ref>

On February 24, 2006 ''[[Kaltio]]'', a culture magazine in northern Finland, got publicity for publishing cartoon of a masked muslim prophet Muhammad<ref>[http://paha.suojelupoliisi.org/sarjis/ Paha.suojelupoliisi.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503201842/http://paha.suojelupoliisi.org/sarjis/ |date=May 3, 2006 }}</ref> which lampooned Finnish political elites' reaction during the cartoon debate. After that some large financial institutions withdrew their advertisements from ''Kaltio'' and the board of the magazine fired their longtime editor Jussi Vilkuna.<ref>[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/856 Brusselsjournal.com]</ref>

====France====
On February 6, 2006, [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Dominique de Villepin]] condemned the violence that had occurred internationally in response to the cartoons, but called for tolerance and respect toward other faiths.<ref>{{cite news|title=Protests in France against controversial cartoons |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1562758.htm |date=February 6, 2006 |publisher=Agence France-Presse |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210012344/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1562758.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

The French foreign minister supported the right to free press, but added that it must be used "in a spirit of tolerance and with respect for beliefs and religions".<ref>{{cite news|title=France enters Muslim cartoon row|date=February 1, 2006|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4669360.stm}}</ref>

[[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then Interior Minister and presidential candidate, said on [[La Chaîne Info|LCI]] television that he "preferred an excess of caricature to an excess of censorship" and pointed out that it is, if necessary, up to the courts to judge whether caricatures go beyond what is reasonable to publish, and not to the governments of Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Embarras et inquiétude chez les responsables politiques français|date=February 3, 2006|work=Le Monde |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3214,36-737587@51-735567,0.html|language=fr}}</ref>

====Germany====
Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that while she understands that feelings were hurt by the caricatures, violent reactions were unacceptable. She stressed the central role of freedom of expression, and called for dialogue. "Denmark must not feel let alone in this issue". Merkel also said that she understands this to be the common position of the E.U.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 4, 2006 |title=Gewalt und Appelle zur Mäßigung im Karikaturenstreit |url=http://de.today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&storyID=2006-02-04T134849Z_01_MAI449721_RTRDEOC_0_KARIKATURSTREIT-2ZF.xml |publisher=Reuters }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

====Indonesia====
President [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] says the Indonesian government condemned the publication of caricature of the muslim Prophet Muhammad. "The publication of the caricature of course reflects a lack of sensitivity to the views and belief of other religious adherents," he said. However, as "religious people", he recommends to "accept the apology".<ref>{{cite news|title=Govt Condemns Publication of Prophet Muhammad's Caricature |publisher=Antara News |date=February 4, 2006 |url=http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=8655 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210010748/http://www.antara.co.id/en/seenws/?id=8655 |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

====Iran====
On February 2, Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] ordered contracts to be cancelled with all countries where media have published the cartoons. On February 5, Iran recalled their ambassador from Denmark, and banned Danish journalists from reporting from Iran. [[Iran]]'s supreme religious leader Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]] said on February 6, 2006, that a "Zionist conspiracy" was to blame for the row over the muslim Prophet Muhammad cartoons, in his first reaction to the controversy: "The reason for the Zionist action is because of the loss they suffered by [[Hamas]] winning". Khamenai was referring to Hamas victory in the [[2006 Palestinian legislative election|Palestinian legislative election]]. In fact, the Palestinian election took place almost four months after the cartoons were first posted.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Former Iranian president, [[Mohammad Khatami]] who is also the theorist of [[Dialogue Among Civilizations]], strongly criticized the Danish cartoons for "spreading hatred", but added that the Muslim world is not entirely blameless either:

<blockquote>Offending and insulting, is different from expressing an opinion that can be analyzed, argued on, and can eventually be accepted or rejected [therefore offending others is not acceptable] ... But in addition to the west, we ourselves also have problems in this regard. Instead of logical criticism or debate, we only keep saying offensive things about liberalism, democracy and modernism. I had told some of our elders before, that the religion of the today's world is 'liberalism' and we have no right to make insults about it. We should not keep using phrases such as "the corrupt culture of the west" etc. in our words.  As it's also said in the Koran, "Do not insult the gods of others, otherwise you are indirectly insulting your God".<ref>[http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-667116&Lang=P Isna.ir] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308010647/http://www.isna.ir/Main/NewsView.aspx?ID=News-667116&Lang=P |date=March 8, 2006 }}, February 15, 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/iran/story/2006/02/060215_jb_khatami_cartoon.shtml BBC.co.uk.co.uk]</ref></blockquote>

The Iranian newspaper [[Hamshahri]] retaliated by organizing a [[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition|holocaust cartoon competition]]. ''Jyllands-Posten'' was challenged to print the winning cartoons of the competition. It agreed at first but after the competition results were announced, ''Jyllands-Posten'' backed down and did not explain why it decided not to print the winning cartoons of the Holocaust cartoon competition. [[Hamshahri]] maintained that ''Jyllands-Posten'' was never interested in freedom of speech but was just spreading hate ideology.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Some Iranian organizations and media have also backed the publications of cartoons with actions such as organizing demonstrations abroad, republishing caricatures, publishing articles defending them, showing them through Satellite Channels or talk about them in radio.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

The following Iranian Organizations are among those who backed the "Freedom of Speech" and publication of Caricatures: [[Atheists Society]], [[Communist Youth Organization]], [[Communist Youth Organization-Hekmatist]], Organization of Iranian Blogwriters, Organization of Women Emancipation, Organization of Women Liberation, [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]], [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran-Hekmatist]] and Organization of Unity of Iranian People Fedayis.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Malaysia====
[[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysian Prime Minister]] [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], current chairman of [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] says "This is a deliberate act of provocation. They should cease and desist from doing so."<ref>"[http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=178636 M'sia Expresses Regret Over Publication Of Prophet's Caricatures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504133028/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=178636 |date=May 4, 2007 }}" ''[[Bernama]]'' 2006-02-03</ref>

====Netherlands====
The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, [[Jan-Peter Balkenende]], issued the following statement (translated): "I regret the threats from the Muslim world. In our world, when someone crosses a line, we take the matter to court. There is no place here for threats and own direction. (I am) Glad there is freedom of speech here. At the same time we have to realize that our images and ideas can be provocative to others."

====New Zealand====
The cartoons were published by two major daily newspapers, the [[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]] and the [[The Press|Christchurch Press]] (both owned by [[Fairfax Media|Fairfax]] of Australia), and by two smaller newspapers, [[the Nelson Mail]] and the [[National Business Review]]. Fleeting glimpses were also shown on two television networks reporting on the issue. The publication ignited a national debate and prompted a peaceful street protest by New Zealand Muslims in Auckland. The publication of the cartoons was condemned by Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]] and opposition leader [[Don Brash]], although they both stated that such decisions were up to newspaper editors to make.  New Zealand has good trading relations with many Islamic countries and there were concerns that the controversy would threaten this. Shortly thereafter the newspapers agreed not to republish the cartoons, and New Zealand Muslim groups, while condemning the cartoons, have asked Muslim countries not to boycott New Zealand goods.

====Nigeria====
On February 7, the parliament of the [[Kano State|State of Kano]] in the [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslim]] north of the country cancelled a €23 million order for Danish buses and banned the sale of all Danish and Norwegian products. Legislators then burned the flags of both nations before a crowd decrying the blasphemy of the caricatures of Muhammad.<ref>[http://www.repubblica.it/2006/b/dirette/sezioni/esteri/vignette/vignet7feb/index.html Cronaca] ''[[La Repubblica]]'' 2006-02-07, repubblica.it</ref> Clashes between rioters and police claimed several lives, with estimates ranging from 16<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/19/muhammadcartoons.ameliahill Nigeria cartoon riots kill 16], Amelia Hill and [[Anushka Asthana]].

====Norway====
The cartoons were first published in [[Aftenposten]] and [[Dagbladet]], but when they were published in the Christian publication [[Magazinet]], and later again in many major Norwegian newspapers, violent reactions and hostile attitude against Norway started. [[Freedom of Speech]] was heavily debated, and there has been great concern about the violent reactions and hostile attitude against Norway.

====Pakistan====
Upper House of parliament adopts a unanimous resolution condemning the Danish newspaper for publishing blasphemous and derogatory cartoons.<ref>[http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0602035383182824.htm Pakistani parliament condemns Danish daily cartoon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506124047/http://www.irna.ir/en/news/view/menu-234/0602035383182824.htm |date=May 6, 2007 }}, ''Islamic Republic News Agency'' 2006-02-03, Irna.ir</ref>
Pakistan's ambassador urged the Danish prime minister to penalize the cartoonists. From February 14–15 protests have occurred, the largest of which took place in [[Peshawar]] where protestors number over 70,000.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,25689-2041723,00.html Timesonline.co.uk]</ref> Other cities have also experienced great unrest such as [[Lahore]] where foreign owned businesses such as [[Pizza Hut]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken|KFC]], and [[McDonald's]] have been burned; [[Islamabad]] where the embassies of Britain, France, and India were targeted; and Tank, a town 142 miles from Peshawar, where protestors burned down shops selling CDs and DVDs.

On February 17, 2006, Ynetnews.com ran an AP article that claims that an Islamic cleric is offering a monetary reward and a new car for killing cartoonists (implied).

{{quote|Mohammed Yousaf Qureshi, prayer leader at the historic Mohabat Khan mosque in the northwestern city of Peshawar, announced the mosque and the Jamia Ashrafia religious school he leads would give a 1.5 million rupee reward and a car for killing the cartoonist of the prophet pictures that appeared first in a Danish newspaper in September.

Whoever has done this despicable and shameful act, he has challenged the honor of Muslims. Whoever will kill this cursed man, he will get one million dollars from the association of the jewelers' bazaar, one million rupees from Masjid Mohabat Khan and 500,000 rupees and a car from Jamia Ashrafia as a reward,}}

Qureshi said.

"This is a unanimous decision by all imams [prayer leaders] of Islam that whoever insults the prophet deserves to be killed and whoever will take this insulting man to his end, will get this prize," Qureshi said.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3217591,00.html Ynetnews.com]</ref>

====Poland====
Polish Prime-Minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] said he considered cartoons to be an unnecessary provocation. The Polish government also said they are quite sorry that the newspaper ''[[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]]'' also offended Muslims.

====Russia====
The president of the Institute of the Middle East, Yevgeny Satanovsky, told [[Itar-Tass]] on February 6 that "The caricatures of Prophet Mohammad published as far back as last September angered the entire Islamic world but especially the countries where [[Iran]]'s influence is the strongest, and the apex of the conflict coincided precisely with the discussion of the Iranian nuclear dossier at the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]]."  This theory is echoed by Scientific Council of the Moscow Carnegie Centre member, Alexei Malashenko, who believes that "the fuss around the caricatures was made artificially."  That is, at a time when the Muslim world has no concerted position either on the [[Iranian nuclear program]] or [[Hamas]], whose ideology is opposed by moderate Islamic regimes, the caricature uproar provides a "pretext for showing how coherent Muslims are."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=ITAR-TASS |date=February 6, 2006 |title=Analysts advise Russia to stay away from "caricature war" |url=http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=2978350&PageNum=0 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060917011727/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=2978350&PageNum=0 |archivedate=September 17, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

====South Africa====
An [[Injunction|interdict]] was obtained to prevent newspapers in South Africa from publishing the cartoons. [[Independent Newspapers (South Africa)]] did however publish an article which [[Muslims]] alleged was [[blasphemous]] and for this reason protest marches were arranged. President [[Thabo Mbeki]] reacted to the granting of the interdict by saying that [[court|the courts]] had spoken and that anyone who had objections to the granting of the interdict could pursue the matter as allowed by [[law|the law]]. He went on to say that the courts had the [[obligation]] to balance rights of citizens to [[freedom of speech]] to those of others to be protected from harm or insult. On February 3 [[Mail & Guardian]] however does print the cartoons.{{Original research inline|date=December 2010}}

====Singapore====
The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore ([[Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura|MUIS]]) issued a statement that said "the inciting of hatred against a faith of a people is very unfortunate," and that "[they] are fortunate and deeply appreciative that in Singapore, the media and the community at large have always been mindful of sensitivities… and have helped to promote racial and religious harmony across society." The Foreign Minister [[George Yeo]] and the Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim have similarly said that the incident shows the need to respect racial and religious sensitivities, have a "responsible media," and to cultivate good inter-religious relations and confidence beyond just legislation. Later, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that the publication of the cartoons depicting Mohammad was provocative and wrong, but he expressed objection to violent response.<ref>{{cite news|date=February 9, 2006|title=Singapore PM: Publication of cartoons on Prophet Mohammad wrong, violent response not right|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/09/content_4159200.htm|publisher=Xinhua Online|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102222221/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-02/09/content_4159200.htm|archivedate=November 2, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

====Sudan====

Danish-Sudanese relations are extremely poor, as are Sudanese relations with most western countries. On February 27, 2008, Sudan decided to boycott Danish goods after the controversial Muhammad cartoons were reprinted by a series of newspapers in Denmark and other European countries. Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir has backed up the country and other Muslim states, requiring them to boycott Danish products just as Sudan did. He even stated that "No Danes shall ever again be able to set foot in Sudan." The two countries subsequently closed their respective embassies.<ref>http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Sudan_boycotts_Danish_goods</ref>

====Sweden====
On February 5, Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Laila Freivalds]] stated the following in an interview:<ref>{{cite news|date=February 5, 2006 |title=Laile Freivalds comments on the demonstrations in Syria and Libanon |url=http://svt.se/svt/road/Classic/shared/mediacenter/player.jsp?d=47535&a=532970 |publisher=SVT |language=sv |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930070441/http://svt.se/svt/road/Classic/shared/mediacenter/player.jsp?d=47535&a=532970 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> ''We support the freedom of speech, that I think is very clear. But at the same time it is important to say that with this freedom comes a certain responsibility, and it could be objectionable to act in a way that insults people.''

The nationalist party [[Swedish Democrats]] (Sverigedemokraterna) started a competition to draw cartoons of Muhammed on their web site. After words of exhortation from the Swedish government, and in particular from the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, the website was shut down. When the story caught wider attention, Freivalds felt it necessary to resign as Minister for having interfered with [[press freedom]]. (For details, see [[Swedish Democrats#The Mohammed cartoon debate]] and [[Laila Freivalds]])

Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], is quoted in the Turkish press saying: "Caricatures of Prophet Muhammad are an attack against our spiritual values.

====United Kingdom====
[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] criticized European newspapers for republishing the cartoons: "There is freedom of speech, we all respect that, ... But there is not any obligation to insult or to be gratuitously inflammatory. I believe that the republication of these cartoons has been unnecessary. It has been insensitive. It has been disrespectful and it has been wrong." Straw also praises British newspapers for their "considerable responsibility and sensitivity" in not printing the cartoons.<ref>{{cite news | title = Muslim Sabbath Marked by Fury |work=Washington Post |date= February 4, 2006 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/03/AR2006020302604.html | first1=Scott | last1=Wilson | first2=Kevin | last2=Sullivan | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref>

Notably, even [[Private Eye]], a satirical magazine generally not afraid to publish controversial items, refused to publish the cartoons, instead printing textual descriptions of each of them in turn. The student newspaper of [[Cardiff University]] published the cartoons, but recalled all copies after protests from the university concerned.{{Original research inline|date=December 2010}}

For us, freedom of expression is at the core of our democracy and it is something that we have shed blood and treasure around the world to defend and we will continue to do so. ... So we would urge all parties to exercise the maximum degree of understanding, the maximum degree of tolerance when they talk about this issue. And we would urge dialogue, not violence.

The controversy produced [[strike action|labour strikes]] and protests in Pakistan, and mass demonstrations in [[Baghdad]] in [[Iraq]]. In the [[Palestinian territories]], thousands of people participated in demonstrations and gunmen in the [[Gaza Strip]] threatened violence against any Scandinavians in the area. The European Union's Gaza offices were raided by 15 masked gunmen from the [[al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades]]. They demanded apologies from Denmark and Norway, but left 30 minutes later without any shots being fired or injuries caused.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Wikinews|title=Fatah assaults European Union office|date=January 30, 2006|url=http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Fatah_assaults_European_Union_office}}</ref>

On February 2, [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] gunmen shut down the EU headquarters in Gaza, in protest of the ''Jyllands-Posten'' drawings. According to CNN, "Masked members of the militant groups Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinians' former ruling party, Fatah, fired bullets into the air, and a man read the group's demands. ... The gunmen left a notice on the EU office's door that the building would remain closed until Europeans apologize to Muslims, many of whom consider the cartoons offensive."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/02/gaza.cartoon/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Gunmen shut EU Gaza office over cartoons|date=February 2, 2006}}</ref>

This is the sunnah of the prophet and the verdict of Islam upon such people, one that any Muslim is able execute."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alghurabaa.co.uk/articles/new/cartoon.htm |title=Kill those who insult the Prophet Muhammad |accessdate=February 3, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204171141/http://www.alghurabaa.co.uk/articles/new/cartoon.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

On January 10, a marginal Norwegian Christian magazine, ''Magazinet'', printed the drawings after getting authorization from ''Jyllands-Posten''. Major newspapers in Norway had printed facsimiles from ''Jyllands-Posten'' and reproduced all the caricatures in their online versions; a few days earlier, the Swedish newspaper ''[[Expressen]]'' had printed two of the drawings in conjunction with an article discussing the event.<ref>{{cite news|first=Pernilla|last=Ouis|date=January 7, 2006|title=Vi måste tåla nidbilderna|url=http://expressen.se/index.jsp?a=501717|publisher=Expressen|language=sv|access-date=February 4, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211013202/http://expressen.se/index.jsp?a=501717|archive-date=February 11, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, it was the ''Magazinet'' printing that led to a great debate in Norway, and is assumed to be the reason for actions directed at Sweden and Norway.{{Original research inline|date=December 2010}}

A Norwegian man made a threat against the lives of the people at the magazine, but later claimed, when faced by the police, that it was just a prank. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry sent a letter to their ambassadors in the Middle East stating that one of the pillars of the Norwegian society is freedom of speech, but they expressed regret that ''Magazinet'' did not respect Muslims' beliefs.<ref>{{cite news|first=Hasan |last=Cucuk |date=January 28, 2006 |title=Norway Apologises for Cartoons Insulting Prophet Mohammed |url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20060128&hn=29124 |publisher=Zaman Online |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207090857/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=international&alt=&trh=20060128&hn=29124 |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}</ref>
