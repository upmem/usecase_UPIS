==Synopsis==
The story of three postmen; "Gordon Leach (Timothy Spall), a slothful couch potato who is in permanent dispute with his svelte wife Hazel (Kay Stonham), who has lost four stone," and who "is offering to entertain ... postman Stan (Eric Richard), when his shifts don't coincide with Gordon's."  "Stan's wife ran off with another man when their daughter, Tina, was six. She is now fourteen. As the film progresses, Stan and his domestic arrangements assume a pivotal importance." The third postman Harold Fish (Tim Barker) and his wife June (Su Elliott), have a dead marriage. Stan is having an affair with June Fish.<ref>Synopsis derives from Coveney, p.160-161</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[Clive James]], then television critic of the ''[[The Observer|Observer]]'', praised Leigh's film: "The gripping story of three postmen and how practically nothing happened to them,..if you can imagine ''[[Cosi fan tutte]]'' with the music taken out, and then with the words taken out, and then with all the decor and costumes replaced by the tackiest fabrics and furniture known to mortal man, you've got a movie by Mike Leigh. That there should be two such original artists as him and [[Bill Forsyth]] loose in Britain at the same time is a remarkable thing."<ref>Clive James, Glued to the Box, p.273-274</ref> The playwright [[David Edgar (playwright)|David Edgar]] was critical, and wondered about Leigh's methods, and techniques, which produced "work of extraordinary, naturalistic perception; but it also appears to produce an attitude to the character of little more than rank contempt." [[Timothy Spall]], (whose father was a postman, and thought the film 'pretty accurate') has said: "If you were to tell me you think Mike's patronising, I'd accuse him of the dead opposite: of elevating, and of making amusing and tragic, what most people in life go through."<ref>Coveney, p160, 163-164</ref>
