A former protégée of British DJ [[John Digweed]], Pole Folder entered the limelight in 2001 as a DJ and producer at the forefront of the European [[progressive house]] movement, and has since evolved into a multi-instrumentalist and live performer of melodic-driven techno, [[tech house]] and [[deep house]].

Pole Folder rose to prominence when his track "Apollo Vibes" was featured on John Digweed's [[Los Angeles]] retrospective in the [[Global Underground series]] on [[Boxed Records]]. This was followed over the course of the following year by the AA single ''Enter the Rhythm/Waxxx'' and a third single, "Dust" (which was again championed by Digweed).

From there, EPs and single projects followed on such labels as [[Sunkissed Records]] and [[Mo-Do Records]], whilst Pole Folder spent much of the next two years focusing on an artist album he had been commissioned to do by John Digweed, making him the first artist to produce an artist album for [[Bedrock Records]]. The album, ''Zero Gold'', featured collaborations with [[Brooklyn]] singer and songwriter [[Shelley Harland]], fellow Belgian Sandra Ferretti and [[Kirsty Hawkshaw]].
Several ''Zero Gold'' tracks such as "Faith on Me" and "Salvation on Slavery Sins" were featured on hit US TV shows, including ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'' and ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''. Pole Folder and CP's "Apollo Vibes" cut was featured in the movie ''[[Stark Raving Mad (2002 film)|Stark Raving Mad]]''.

In 2006, Pole Folder produced a series of projects and EPs for [[Mashtronic Records]] and [[Proton Music]].  Pole Folder has also performed as a DJ and live artist internationally. He also ran a digital record label called Reworck since 2010. The label is supported by the likes of John Digweed, Hernan Cattaneo, and Laurent Garnier.
