==Lyrics==

TWILIGHT

:Adieu! and the sun goes awearily down,
:The mist creeps up o'er the sleepy town,
:The white sails bend to the shuddering mere,
:And the reapers have reaped, and the night is here.

:Adieu! and the years are a broken song,
:The right grows weak in the strife with wrong,
:The lilies of love have a crimson stain,
:And the old days never will come again.

:Adieu! Some time shall the veil between
:The things that are, and that might have been,
:Be folded back for our eyes to see,
:And the meaning of all be clear to me.
