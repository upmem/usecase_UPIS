===[[Matriculation fetishism]]===
Neologism. Google hits? Zilch. [[User:Ifnord|Ifnord]] 18:07, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. --[[User:W.marsh|W.marsh]] 18:08, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom. --[[User:Aaron|Aaron]] 18:22, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Unverifiable neologism.  Not worth merging into [[fetishism]] (like I had to say that). --[[User:Kinu|Kinu]] 18:56, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Speedy BJAODN'''. [[User:Daniel Case|Daniel Case]] 20:07, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*Proceed directly to '''BJAODN'''.  Do not pass Go.  Do not collect $200. <font style="font-variant: small-caps;"> -- [[User:Shinmawa|ShinmaWa]]<sup>([[User_talk:Shinmawa|talk]])</sup></font> 21:45, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. No Google matches, and sounds rather implausible. -- [[User:Mithent|Mithent]] 22:12, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
* '''Comment''': At least it's a funny hoax. The really funny thing is, I'm sure it's true of someone, somewhere. I just hope it never becomes notable, or I'm ending my education.  <b><font color="000000">[[User:Adrian Lamo|A]]</font></b><font color="#646060">drian</font><b> <font color="#000000">[[User_Talk:Adrian_Lamo|L]]</font></b><font color="#646060">amo </font><b><font color="#F660AB">·· </font></b> 23:53, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete as stupid''' but on the plus side, it made me laugh for a full minute. [[User:Bobby1011|Bobby1011]] 19:03, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
