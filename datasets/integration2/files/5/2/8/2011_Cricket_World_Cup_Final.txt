The '''2011 Cricket World Cup Final''' was a [[One Day International]] (ODI) match played between [[India national cricket team|India]] and [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] at the [[Wankhede Stadium]], [[Mumbai]], India on 2 April 2011, Saturday. The culmination of the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|tenth edition of the World Cup]], it was the first time that these two teams had met each other at this stage in the tournament history. India won the match by six wickets{{mdash}}its second World Cup win after the [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 tournament]]{{mdash}}and became the third team to have won the title more than once, after [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and later 2015) and the [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] (1975 and 1979).<ref name="BBC-Power">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|title=India power past Sri Lanka to Cricket World Cup triumph|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2011|access-date=2 April 2011|first=Sam|last=Sheringham| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035451/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm| archive-date= 3 April 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref> 

Both teams had progressed through three stages to reach the final. India had won all but two matches to that point, losing to South Africa and tying with England in the group stage. Sri Lanka had won all but one completed match, against Pakistan. The Sri Lanka captain [[Kumar Sangakkara]] chose to bat first after winning the toss. The team scored slowly until the 17th over when they lost both their openers. Sangakkara added 62 runs with [[Mahela Jayawardene]] before being dismissed for 48 runs. Although wickets kept falling at one end, Jayawardene scored 103 runs in 88 balls; he was involved in a partnership of 66 runs with [[Thisara Perera]]. The pair took Sri Lanka's total to 274 runs at the close of the innings.

In reply, India lost their opener [[Virender Sehwag]] to the second ball of the innings, out LBW by [[Lasith Malinga]]. [[Sachin Tendulkar]], too, got out quickly. The next set of batsmen, [[Gautam Gambhir]] and [[Virat Kohli]], added 83 runs in 15 overs before the latter got out in the 22nd over. India captain [[MS Dhoni]], promoting himself up the order, joined Gambhir and they both added 109 runs, an Indian record in a World Cup final. Gambhir got out for 97 runs in the 42nd over. India chased down the total and won the match by six wickets in the 49th over. Dhoni was declared the "man of the match" for scoring 91 runs, while his compatriot [[Yuvraj Singh]] was awarded the "man of the tournament".

The match was watched by about 42,000 spectators at the venue and about 135 million viewers on television in India.<ref name=hin>{{cite news|title=World Cup win shatters all records as 67.6mn tune in |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/cricket/world-cup-2011/World-Cup-win-shatters-all-records-as-67-6mn-tune-in/newdelhi/SP-Article10-680878.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407014013/http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/cricket/world-cup-2011/World-Cup-win-shatters-all-records-as-67-6mn-tune-in/newdelhi/SP-Article10-680878.aspx |archive-date=7 April 2011 }}</ref><ref name="135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM">{{citation|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |title=135 mn saw World Cup final: TAM |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=10 April 2011 |access-date=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413055801/http://www.hindustantimes.com/135-mn-saw-World-Cup-final-TAM/Article1-683623.aspx |archive-date=13 April 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Economic Times">{{cite news|title=World Cup final had highest rating: TAM|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-04-07/news/29392442_1_peak-rating-highest-rating-star-cricket|access-date=13 February 2015|work=Economic Times}}</ref> This was the second time in World Cup history that a host nation won the final and the first time to win on their [[home ground]].

==Background==
The [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] was the tenth [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). The competition took place between 19 February and 2 April 2011. Co-hosted by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the tournament was the third World Cup to be played in the Indian subcontinent. The ICC ruled out Pakistan citing security reasons. There were 14 participating teams, which included four [[List of International Cricket Council members#Associate Members|associate members of the ICC]]{{mdash}}[[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]], [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]], [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Netherlands national cricket team|Netherlands]].<ref name="thenews">{{cite news|title=Canada, Kenya and Netherlands join Ireland at World Cup|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/archive/amp/171643-canada-kenya-and-netherlands-join-ireland-at-world-cup|work=[[The News International]]|date=18 April 2009|access-date=4 April 2017}}</ref>

The match was the tenth World Cup final and was hosted at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai. It was the first time the city has hosted a World Cup final, and was the second final to be hosted by India, after the [[1987 Cricket World Cup Final|1987 final]] held at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. The 2011 final was the first to feature two teams from the same continent, and the first time that two co-hosts contested the final.<ref name=toi/>

India were making their 3rd appearance in a World Cup final. Previously, they won the final in [[1983 Cricket World Cup Final|1983]], and lost in [[2003 Cricket World Cup Final|2003]]. Sri Lanka was appearing in their third World Cup final; breakthrough winners against Australia in [[1996 Cricket World Cup Final|1996]] they finished as runners up (also to Australia) in the previous World Cup in [[2007 Cricket World Cup Final|2007]]. Prior to this match, India and Sri Lanka had met each other seven times in World Cup history with Sri Lanka ahead with four wins and two defeats and one game ending in a no-result. In One Day Internationals, India led Sri Lanka with 75 victories against 52 victories for Sri Lanka, while 11 matches had ended with no result.<ref name=toi>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesjungle.net/cricket-games/ |title=Cricket games Online |publisher=Gamesjungle.net |date=2012-08-09 |access-date=2016-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728225402/http://www.gamesjungle.net/cricket-games |archive-date=28 July 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The final generated huge interest. The [[President of Sri Lanka]] [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]], a known cricket enthusiast, announced he would attend the match along with his sons. Following this, the Indian President [[Pratibha Patil]] also announced her decision to attend the match.

==Road to the final==
{{main|2011 Cricket World Cup}}

Sri Lanka qualified for the knockouts with a second-place finish in [[2011 Cricket World Cup Group A|Group A]]. They won four of their six games, suffered a defeat against Pakistan and against Australia was washed out. Being level on points with Australia, they were placed second in the group due to their better net run rate.

India were drawn in [[2011 Cricket World Cup Group B|Group B]] where they finished second behind South Africa. They managed wins in four of their six games, lost one against South Africa while their game against England was a high scoring tie.

Sri Lanka had clinically demolished England in the quarter final, defeating them by 10 wickets. Both the Sri Lankan openers, [[Tillakaratne Dilshan]] and [[Upul Tharanga]] made unbeaten centuries and put up a world-record stand for the first wicket in a World Cup. The New Zealand semi-final was more keenly contested, but was still won with relative ease by Sri Lanka. The matches showcased the effective unconventional bowling of pace spearhead [[Lasith Malinga]], restrictive fielding, and the batting prowess of the Sri Lankan top order.

Both of India's knockout matches were high-pressure contests. Australia was a strong team and the defending champions, and India had to give a very good performance to restrict Australia to 260 and then successfully chase down the target even as wickets fell regularly. India and their semi-final opponents, Pakistan, have historically been rivals, and there was immense public pressure on both teams with the match attended by the [[Prime Minister]]s of both countries. India batted first and ultimately defeated Pakistan by 29 runs.

==Team composition==
India largely retained the same team it had in the semi-final against Pakistan, with just one change. [[Ashish Nehra]], left-arm medium [[Fast bowling|pacer]], had suffered a finger fracture while fielding in that match, and he was replaced by another pacer, [[Sreesanth]]. India was widely rated as having the strongest batting line-up in the tournament, and chose to back this strength throughout the campaign by playing seven batsmen and four bowlers. Due to [[Yuvraj Singh]] performing well with both bat and ball in the tournament, India could afford to play with only four specialist bowlers. Yuvraj bowled his full quota of 10 overs in many matches, including the semi-final against Pakistan. Among the four bowling slots, [[Zaheer Khan]] was the pace spearhead supported in most matches by [[Munaf Patel]], while [[Harbhajan Singh]] was the regular [[off-spinner]]. The fourth slot was taken by different bowlers in different matches, including Sreesanth, Nehra, [[leg-spinner]] [[Piyush Chawla]], or off-spinner [[Ravichandran Ashwin]]. The captain had chosen Nehra over Ashwin in the match against Pakistan also. Indian captain [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] had then said he preferred having three [[Seam bowling|seamers]] because it gave him more options. He already had proven spinners in Harbhajan and Yuvraj, and could call upon many other Indian players who can bowl part-time spin (including [[Sachin Tendulkar]], [[Suresh Raina]], and [[Virender Sehwag]]).

Sri Lanka made four changes to their side from the semi-final. [[All-rounder]] [[Angelo Mathews]] had suffered a torn quadriceps and could not play. Sri Lanka knew the Indians' strength was batting, and thus they needed to take wickets to put them under pressure. This led to their choosing a full complement of bowlers. Spin bowler [[Ajantha Mendis]] had performed well throughout the tournament, but he had a poor record against India in pre-World Cup clashes and was not chosen for the final. Spinner [[Rangana Herath]] was also dropped. Off-spinner [[Suraj Randiv]] and batsman [[Chamara Kapugedera]] were flown in from Sri Lanka to strengthen the side. Seamers [[Nuwan Kulasekara]] and [[Thisara Perera]], who had played matches in the earlier group stage, were drafted into the team. Legendary spinner [[Muttiah Muralitharan]] was carrying minor injuries, but was retained. He had announced that he would retire from One Day International cricket after the World Cup, so this was his last match. The semi-final held at the [[Premadasa Stadium]] in [[Colombo]] was his last ODI match on home soil, and there he had been carried around the stadium, perched on his teammates' shoulders, on a lap of honour after that match.

===Toss===
A controversy developed when [[Kumar Sangakkara]] called the toss. The toss came up as heads, but the match referee [[Jeff Crowe]] did not hear the call over the crowd.

===Sri Lankan innings===

Sri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and [[Virat Kohli]] inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive [[Maiden over|maidens]] and the wicket of [[Upul Tharanga]], conceding only six runs in his five-over spell.<ref name="SriLanka Batting">{{cite web | url =http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/content/current/story/509121.html | title = India v Sri Lanka: MS Dhoni and Gautam Gambhir lead India to World Cup glory |  publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| access-date = 2 April 2011| date = 2 April 2011}}</ref> Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was [[bowled]] by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Captain Kumar Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. [[Mahela Jayawardene]] came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman [[Thilan Samaraweera]] was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 [[not out]] from 88 balls in a high-class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45–50 overs) to take the score to 274/6.<ref name="SriLanka Batting"  />

===Indian innings===

India had a shaky start, with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissed]] early by Lasith Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Sehwag was trapped [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] for a [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] on the second ball of the [[innings]]. Tendulkar started with some good strokes, racing to 18 off 14 balls, but then edged a catch to [[wicketkeeper]] Sangakkara. Virat Kohli and [[Gautam Gambhir]] started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball high up in the air, but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at [[long off]]. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five, usually the position of Yuvraj Singh. Both Kohli and Dhoni are right-handed batsmen, while Gambhir and Yuvraj are left-handed. Along with other considerations, by coming ahead of Yuvraj, Dhoni ensured there would be a right-left batting combination between him and Gambhir, which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm, and necessitates frequent field changes. Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets, and later accelerating with a greater flow of [[Boundary (cricket)|boundaries]]. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to bring up his [[century (cricket)|century]] with a boundary, but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball, and he was bowled by Thisara Perera. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls.<ref name=finalscorecard>{{cite web | url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/current/match/433606.html | title = Final: India v Sri Lanka at Mumbai – ICC World Cup Final 2011| access-date = 2 April 2011| date = 2 April 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110416043712/http://www.espncricinfo.com/icc_cricket_worldcup2011/engine/current/match/433606.html| archive-date= 16 April 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/02/india-sri-lanka-cricket-world-cup|title=Mahendra Dhoni steers India past Sri Lanka in Cricket World Cup final|date=2 April 2011|work=Guardian|access-date=5 April 2011|location=London|first=Vic|last=Marks}}</ref> Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. Like in many other day-night matches in the subcontinent, dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night, making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of India's batting. However, this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/02/india-sri-lanka-cricket-live|title=World Cup Final over by over|work=Guardian|date=2 April 2011|access-date=6 April 2011|location=London|first1=Rob|last1=Smyth|first2=Sean|last2=Ingle}}</ref> By crossing the target of 274, India had set a record for the highest successful run-chase in a World Cup final.<ref name="SriLanka Batting"  />

At the end of the match, the batting strength of both the teams stood out. The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists: Tillekaratne Dilshan (500 runs), Sachin Tendulkar (482), and Kumar Sangakkara (465). In the top 10 tournament scorers, there were 3 from Sri Lanka (Upul Tharanga (395) in addition to the previous two), and 4 from India (Gautam Gambhir (393), Virender Sehwag (380), and Yuvraj Singh (362) in addition to Sachin).

==Post-match ceremony and celebrations==
In the post-match presentation, the Sri Lankan captain Kumar Sangakkara said that the Indians batted very well, and "looks like you need to make something like 350 runs to put them under pressure." The then Indian captain MS Dhoni said that he had added motivation to play well to justify some unexpected decisions he had made for this match, like playing Sreesanth instead of [[Ravichandran Ashwin|Ashwin]], and promoting himself up the order above Yuvraj. MS Dhoni was named [[Man of the Match]] for his powerful and match-winning batting display under pressure. Yuvraj Singh was named Man of the Tournament for good all-round performance with both bat and ball throughout the tournament.

After the presentation, an ecstatic Indian team first held the Cup amid showers of champagne and confetti. Some Indian players, including Harbhajan Singh, Sachin Tendulkar, and Yuvraj Singh, had tears in their eyes. The team then carried iconic player Tendulkar on a victory lap around the stadium. Coach [[Gary Kirsten]] was also carried around the ground later. The Indian players dedicated their victory to Tendulkar; Virat Kohli said, "he has carried the burden of the nation for 21 years. It is time we carried him on our shoulders."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444808.stm|title=Cricket World Cup: Indians dedicate win to Tendulkar|publisher=BBC|date=2 April 2011|access-date=3 April 2011}}</ref> Gautam Gambhir dedicated the victory to the victims of the 26/11 [[Mumbai attacks]], and to the soldiers guarding India's borders.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i4g0PUtdtho36sg4LtKD9gCo-S6Q?docId=CNG.af23e3ad9da0de3ae5ee0b89c2af2d82.61|publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=1 April 2011|title=India's Gambhir vows to win for Mumbai victims}}</ref>

==After match==

===Reception in Sri Lanka===
Though Sri Lankan spectators were initially disappointed, they eventually rallied behind their team and welcomed them at the airport with garlands, cheers, and celebration. Sri Lanka's excellent performance throughout the World Cup was appreciated, and it was recognised that reaching the final was a significant achievement in itself. Opening batsman Tillekaratne Dilshan was the highest run scorer in the tournament, with Sangakkara being the third highest (the second highest was Sachin Tendulkar of India).

The Sri Lankan President [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] hosted High Tea for the Sri Lankan players and spouses on the grounds of the Presidential residence, [[Temple Trees]].

===Reception in India===
Indian fans were ecstatic at the win, and at the overall performance of the team through the tournament. Celebrations went on through most of India over the weekend.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The Indian President Pratibha Patil hosted High Tea for the Indian players and spouses on the grounds of the Raj Bhavan (Governor's House) in Mumbai.

There was no ticker tape parade for the team on an open bus (as was organised after the [[2007 Twenty20 World Cup]] win) because of the hectic schedule, with the 2011 edition of the [[Indian Premier League]] starting on 8 April.

===Change in the Sri Lanka team===
After some days of deliberation, Kumar Sangakkara, the Sri Lankan captain, announced on 5 April that he was resigning from the post of captain of the One Day International and [[Twenty20]] sides in the long-term interest of the team. According to him, as he would be 37 by the time of the 2015 World Cup, could not be sure of his place in the side then and it would be better for a new captain to be groomed now, who would be at the peak of his career during that tournament. He stated he was willing to captain the team for the upcoming tours of England and possibly Australia if the selectors felt this would aid the transition to a new captaincy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/apr/05/sri-lanka-kumar-sangakkara-captain|title=Kumar Sangakkara stands down|date=5 April 2011|access-date=6 April 2011|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> A day after Sangakkara's announcement, Mahela Jayawardene resigned from the post of vice-captain, and [[Aravinda de Silva]] from the post of Chairman of Selectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/More-wickets-fall-in-lanka-cricket-Mahela-Aravinda-resigns/Article1-681967.aspx|title=More wickets fall in Lanka cricket|date=6 April 2011|access-date=6 April 2011|publisher=[[Hindustan Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407073156/http://www.hindustantimes.com/more-wickets-fall-in-lanka-cricket-mahela-aravinda-resigns/article1-681967.aspx|archive-date=7 April 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==In Popular Culture==
The match formed the climax of 2016 Indian film [[M.S. Dhoni : The Untold Story]], the biopic of then Indian captain [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]. The archived footages of the actual match were used and the face of the lead actor was used instead of Dhoni's face. M.S. Dhoni was portrayed by [[Sushant Singh Rajput]].

In [[Sachin Tendulkar]]'s biopic movie [[Sachin: A Billion Dreams]] the match is also a significant part of the story plot.
