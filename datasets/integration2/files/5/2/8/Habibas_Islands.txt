The '''Habibas islands''' ( {{lang-ar|جزر حبيبة}}) {{coord|35|43|29|N|1|8|00|W}} are located about 12&nbsp;km off the [[Algeria]]n coast, northwest of [[Oran]].  The islands consist of a principal island  1.3&nbsp;km long surrounded by an [[archipelago]] covering a total area of about 40 ha.<ref name="algeria.com">http://www.algeria.com/blog/iles-habibas-marine-nature-reserve</ref>  The highest point on the Habibas islands reaches 105 m. The islands are of [[volcanic]] origin.

The Habibas islands fall under the [[Bou Zedjar]] municipality in the [[Aïn Témouchent Province]], Algeria.
There are no permanent population centres, but there is a small [[jetty]], a [[lighthouse]] (built in 1879) and a few small buildings. The islands make up the Iles Habibas Marine Nature Reserve.<ref name="algeria.com"/>

By the end of 2006, a project to rehabilitate and maintain the island was to commence, backed by Algerian and [[France|French]] funding. The stated objective was to support the local [[ecosystem]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.visitoran.com/news/article.asp?106 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203032355/http://www.visitoran.com/news/article.asp?106 |archive-date=2013-12-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
