Lady '''Harriet Kavanagh''' (13 October 1799 – 14 July 1885) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] artist, traveller, and antiquarian,<ref name=Murphy>{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=David|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=Kavanagh, Lady Harriet Margaret }}</ref> described as a "woman of high culture and of unusual artistic power." She is thought to be the first Irish female traveller to Egypt.<ref name=Jackson />

==Early life and family==
Harriet Kavanagh was born Lady Harriet Margaret Le Poer Trench on 13 October 1799.<ref name="The Peerage">{{cite web|title=Lady Harriete Margaret Le Poer Trench|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p20435.htm#i204344|website=The Peerage|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> She was the second daughter of [[Richard Trench, 2nd Earl of Clancarty|Richard Le Poer Trench]] and Henrietta Margaret Le Poer Trench (née Staples), with three brothers and three sisters. She married [[Thomas Kavanagh (politician)|Thomas Kavanagh]] of [[Borris, County Carlow#History|Borris House, County Carlow]] on 28 February 1825, as his second wife.<ref name=Murphy /> The couple had four children, three sons Charles, Thomas, Arthur, and one daughter, Harriet or "Hoddy."<ref name=Jackson>{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Emmet|title=Lady Harriet Kavanagh|url=http://www.irishegyptology.com/ladyharrietkavanagh/|website=Irish Egyptology|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref>

Her third son, [[Arthur MacMorrough Kavanagh]], was born without fully formed limbs. Some attributed the disability to a peasant’s curse, whilst others have speculated it was due to Lady Kavanagh taking [[laudanum]] during her pregnancy.<ref name=Bunbury>{{cite web|last1=Bunbury|first1=Turtle|title=The Incredible Arthur MacMorrough Kavanagh (1831 – 1889)|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_heroes/hist_hero_arthur_kavanagh.html|website=Turtle Bunbury|accessdate=16 July 2015}}</ref> Kavanagh refused to treat her son differently to his siblings, and with the help of local doctor Francis Boxwell, raised him as a normal child. During his initial education, Kavanagh taught Arthur herself, teaching him to paint and then write by holding brushes and pens in his mouth.<ref name=Murphy /> With the help of the surgeon [[Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Crampton]], she has a mechanical wheelchair constructed for Arthur, and also encouraged him to ride horses and engage in other outdoor activities.<ref name=Bunbury /> Kavanagh's husband died after 12 years of marriage, in 1837.<ref name=Jackson />

==Travelling==
In 1846, Kavanagh took her children to learn French in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], later travelling to [[Rome]]. As an antiquarian, Kavanagh also wanted to visit [[Egypt]] and the [[Holy Land]], setting off on the long journey from [[Marseilles]] in October 1846. Accompanying her were her daughter, Harriet, her two sons, Thomas and Arthur, and their tutor, the Rev. David Wood. In [[Cairo]], she hired two [[felucca]]s with Arab crews, and visited archaeological sites along the [[Nile]], such as [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Karnak]], and the [[Nubia]] region. From there, Kavanagh visited sites of biblical interest, including [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], and [[Rhoda Island]]. She negotiated with Bedouin chiefs in [[Aqaba]], hiring camels and Bedouin guides to travel to [[Hebron]].<ref name=Murphy /> Whilst in Cairo, Kavanagh became acquainted with a number of fellow Europeans, including [[Charles Murray (author and diplomat)|Sir Charles Murray]], [[Sophia Lane Poole]], and [[Edward William Lane]]. [[Harriet Martineau]] travelled with the party from Cairo to the Holy Land.<ref name=Jackson />

Whilst visiting [[Jerusalem]] in Easter 1847, she bore witness to a confrontation over the control of holy places between Roman and Orthodox Catholics priests. She went on to visit [[Petra]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Beirut]], [[Smyrna]], and [[Constantinople]]. The group spent a second winter in Egypt before travelling to the Black Sea before returning to Marseilles in April 1848. Much of these journeys were conducted on horse or camel-back, with one desert crossing taking 36 days. Kavanagh later commented on her travels as a woman, stating "quite enough danger to make it a very exciting business."<ref name=Murphy />

In 1850 and 1852, Kavanagh travelled to [[Corfu]], returning to Borris with samples of Greek lace. She taught a number of her tenants to copy these designs, which led to the establishment of a local lace-making industry.<ref name=Murphy /> She was elected to the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland|Kilkenny Archaeological Society]] in 1851.<ref name=Jackson />

==Later life==
Kavanagh moved to Ballyragget Lodge, [[County Kilkenny]] in 1860, dying there on 14 July 1885. She is buried in St Mullin's Abbey, Borris. Kavanagh documented her travels in journals, with drawings and paintings of the sites she visited. These are held by the Kavanagh family, along with an oil portrait and a self-portrait. Her collection of roughly 300 Egyptian antiquities were donated to the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] after her death. These collections were later moved to the [[National Museum of Ireland]], and form a core element of the Museum's Egyptian collection. Copies of two of her watercolours, a self-portrait, and a landscape are on display in the Museum.<ref name=Murphy />
