==Research==
Welch is known for his research into [[cancer screening]]. In 2012, Welch co-authored a study which found that [[mammography]] was having little to no impact on breast cancer death rates. The study also concluded that substantial [[overdiagnosis]] was associated with mammographic screening, "accounting for nearly a third of all newly diagnosed breast cancers."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bleyer|first1=Archie|last2=Welch|first2=H.

The piece found that thyroid-cancer mortality has not changed appreciably there from 1993 to 2011, despite the rate of diagnoses for this type of cancer increasing by a factor of 15 during the same time period.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ahn|first1=Hyeong Sik|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun Jung|last3=Welch|first3=H.

In 2016, he led a study which concluded that women were more likely to be diagnosed with a small tumor that will never increase in size through mammography than they are to have a dangerous tumor detected through the practice.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=H.

In 2018, after a 20-month investigation, Dartmouth College determined that Welch had "engaged in research misconduct, namely, plagiarism, by knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly appropriating the ideas, processes, results or words of Complainants without giving them appropriate credit, and that these actions represented a significant departure from accepted practices of the relevant research community." Welch disputed the investigation's finding, telling [[Retraction Watch]] that "the underlying data are publicly available — all the analyses, all the figures and all the writing in the article are my co-authors' and mine."<ref>{{cite news

==Views on early detection==
Welch is critical of the concept of [[early detection]] in medicine,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.minnpost.com/second-opinion/2014/11/thyroid-cancer-south-korea-cautionary-tale-about-dangers-overdiagnosis | title=Thyroid cancer in South Korea: a cautionary tale about the dangers of overdiagnosis | work=MinnPost | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=16 July 2015 | author=Perry, Susan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bu.edu/today/2011/medical-overdiagnosis-bad-for-you-good-for-business/ | title=Overdiagnosis: Bad for You, Good for Business | work=BU Today | date=26 October 2011 | accessdate=16 July 2015 | author=Chedekel, Lisa}}</ref> stating that "we have exaggerated the benefits of medical care, and we've underplayed — or ignored entirely — the harms. This is particularly true when it comes to early detection."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/16/8423051/too-much-cancer-screening | title=Celebrities keep pushing for more cancer screening.
