'''[[Cley Marshes]]''' is a [[nature reserve]] on the [[North Sea]] coast of England just outside the village of [[Cley next the Sea]],  [[Norfolk]]. A reserve since 1926, it is the oldest of the reserves belonging to the [[Norfolk Wildlife Trust]]. Cley Marshes protects an area of [[reed bed]]s, freshwater [[marsh]], [[pond|pools]] and [[wet meadow]]s, and has been designated as a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] due to the large flocks of birds it attracts. The reserve is important for some scarce breeding species, such as [[pied avocet]]s on the islands, and [[western marsh harrier]]s, [[Eurasian bittern]]s and [[bearded reedling]]s in the reeds, and is a major [[bird migration|migration]] stopoff and wintering site. There are also several nationally or locally scarce [[invertebrate]]s and plants specialised for this coastal habitat. The reserve has an environmentally friendly [[visitor center|visitor centre]] and five [[bird hide]]s, and attracts large numbers of visitors, contributing significantly to the economy of Cley village. Despite centuries of [[levee|embanking]] to reclaim land and protect the village, the marshes have been flooded many times; the southward march of the [[shingle beach|coastal shingle]] bank and encroachment by the sea make it inevitable that the reserve will eventually be lost. {{TFAFULL|Cley Marshes}}
