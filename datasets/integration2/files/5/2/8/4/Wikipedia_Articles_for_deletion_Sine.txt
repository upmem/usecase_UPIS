The result was  '''procedural keep''' <small>([[Wikipedia:NACD#Non-administrators_closing_discussions|non-admin closure]])</small>. This concern should be addressed through a [[Wikipedia:Merging|merging]] discussion on the relevant talk pages, or by creating articles for [[Tangent (function)]] and [[Cosine]], not with an AfD.

The other trigonometric functions are redirects, so this one should be a redirect too. [[User:GeoffreyT2000|GeoffreyT2000]] ([[User talk:GeoffreyT2000|talk]]) 21:33, 16 July 2015 (UTC)
:'''Commment''' so that would be a redirect to [[Trigonometric_functions#Sine.2C_cosine_and_tangent]] presumably. [[User:Siuenti|Siuenti]] ([[User talk:Siuenti|talk]]) 21:58, 16 July 2015 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' There's lots here that's not in [[Trigonometric_functions#Sine.2C_cosine_and_tangent]], and there's a lot more that can be said about sines than just the definition. Some is in other articles (e.g. [[List of trigonometric identities]]), but this is still a useful and encyclopedic topic. It's a [[WP:OSE|bad argument]] to say "there's no article on cosines so we should delete the article on sines": this is a wiki, and articles aren't created according to a careful plan. Maybe we need an article on cosines. Plus, if you're going to propose a redirect (a) do it on [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion]] not here, and (b) say what you think it should actually redirect to.

*'''Speedy close as invalid'''.  AfD is not for redirection, which is does not require any special process.  You could just do it and see if you get reverted, or less provocatively, you could use the [[Wikipedia:Proposed mergers]] procedure.  Note that I have no strong opinion on whether [[sine]] should be a separate article. --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 02:22, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' I see no reason not to have a more specific and detailed article on sine than could be incorporated in a more general article on trigonometric functions. [[User:JRSpriggs|JRSpriggs]] ([[User talk:JRSpriggs|talk]]) 06:18, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

*'''Comment'''.  There is definitely scope for a separate article, but I don't think the current arrangement of content is ideal.  There is some good content at [[sine]], but probably contains too much overlap with the existing article [[trigonometric functions]].  An article on the sine could include things like the tables that appear later on, series and product developments, continued fraction expansions, etc.  Similar articles could be spun off for the other trigonometric functions as well.  In fact, if anything it's strange that we don't have articles about each of these.

*'''Comment'''. It does seem odd to have a separate article for sine but not cosine or tangent. Cotangent and cosecant seem less notable but where do you draw the line? The [[trigonometric functions]] article is probably too long and there should be less trying to include everything in one page and more putting the details into linked articles. Not sure that we need a separate article for all six functions though. Maybe rename 'sine' to 'sine and cosine', or leave the name and just include cosine in the sine article since they're really the same with a domain shift. You could do something similar with the remaining functions. Note, we do have a separate articles for [[versine]] and [[exsecant]] which cover the "forgotten" functions. I agree with some of the other comments that this should have been a proposed merge, not an AfD. --[[User:RDBury|RDBury]] ([[User talk:RDBury|talk]]) 19:03, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
*'''SNOW Keep''' per [[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]]'s reasoning. This is a merge discussion, not a deletion discussion, and nobody can argue that the topic cannot support a separate article. Asking why cos and tan lack their own articles is silly: they could support stand-alone articles too. Not all the contents are duplicated at [[trigonometric functions]], and the question of whether there's too much overlap in coverage belongs on article talk pages, not at AfD. --[[User:Sammy1339|Sammy1339]] ([[User talk:Sammy1339|talk]]) 01:49, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
