The site is acid heath on both sides of Marshalls Heath Lane. It is secondary woodland and scrub, but the many species recorded include forty on national lists of threatened species. [[Yellow hill ant]]s are very common, and it is one of the key Hertfordshire sites for butterflies and moths.<ref name=LNR/> The site was managed by the [[Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust]] between 1972 and 1993, when the council terminated the agreement with the trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheathampstead.net/mh/history.htm|title=Marshalls Heath Nature Reserve: History|publisher=Wheathampstead.net |accessdate=  16 July 2015}}</ref>
