==Background==

''Community Swing'' was composed by Glenn Miller in 1937 and recorded on June 9, 1937 at the Brunswick studios in New York and released as a Brunswick 78, 7923, Matrix #B 21236-1, backed with "Sleepy Time Gal".<ref>Flower, John. ''Moonlight Serenade''. Arlington House, 1972.</ref> Arranged by Glenn Miller, the instrumental featured Mannie Klein on trumpet, Hal McIntyre on clarinet, and George T. Simon on drums. The 78 release on Vocalion in the UK, S-127, B-21236-1, was reviewed in the February, 1938 issue of the British classical music magazine ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'':

<blockquote>Many of you will remember Glenn Miller as one of the chief arrangers for the [[Dorsey Brothers]] when they ran a joint orchestra, and [[Red Nichols]] in the days of the Five Pennies. He is also of course one of the best trombone players of the old jazz school.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One of Miller's pet devices was to bestow a rich warmth of tone colour on a simple melody by scoring it in close harmony for instruments playing in the lower register, with comparatively little deviation from the original theme or intricate weaving of counter melodic effects. ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Community Swing" as a composition is more on the lick-and-answer principle... But even here one finds Miller's penchant for quality and richness of tone, and the same nice, clean straightforward phrasing.<ref>[http://www.gramophone.net/Issue/Page/February%201938/31/860182/Glenn+Miller+and+His+Orchestra+(Am.)+Community+swing+(+Miller)+(B21236)+Sleepy+time+gal+(Lorenzo,+Whiting)+(B21235)+(Vocalion%E2%80%94S+I+2+Miller+(troth)+with+Geo.+Firaro,+Hal+McIntyre+(altos)+Carl+Biesecker+(ten)+Ch.+Spivak,+Mannie+Klein,+Sterling+Bose+(Imps)+Jeffe+Ralph,+Harry+Rodgers,+Jerry+Jerome+(trmbs)+Howard+Smith+(p)+Dick+McDonough+(g)+Ted+Kots+aftis+(b)+Geo.+Simon+(ds.).

Jazz critic and journalist Paul Eduard Miller reviewed the composition in the August, 1937 issue of ''[[Down Beat]]'': "Miller’s own tune, is a snappy arrangement, ensemble for the most part." <ref>Flower, John. Liner notes to ''Best of Big Bands: Evolution of a Band'', Glenn Miller, Sony, 1992.</ref>

The song was performed on a January 16, 1937 Saturday Night Swing Club radio broadcast with Glenn Miller conducting. Glenn Miller and His Orchestra also performed the song on July 21, 1937 and August 23, 1937 from the Hotel Roosevelt for a New Orleans radio broadcast.
