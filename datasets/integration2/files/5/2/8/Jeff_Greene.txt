Greene worked many jobs to put himself through college at [[Johns Hopkins University]], graduating in three years with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[economics]] and [[sociology]].

==Career==
Greene began investing in [[real estate]] while in business school, and built a successful real estate business from being a busboy at the Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach.<ref name="CNBC 2008-2-29">{{Cite news |last=Wells |first=Jane |date=2008-02-29 |title=Real Estate Mogul Jeff Greene: The Man Who Shorted Subprime |work=CNBC |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/23407363/Real_Estate_Mogul_Jeff_Greene_The_Man_Who_Shorted_Subprime |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221849/http://www.cnbc.com/id/23407363/Real_Estate_Mogul_Jeff_Greene_The_Man_Who_Shorted_Subprime |archive-date=2011-06-10}}</ref> In mid-2006, Greene, worried about the possible collapse of the real estate market, spoke with [[John Paulson]], a fellow investor who discussed with Greene his investing strategy. They agreed that the real estate market was unstable and a bubble might be forming in housing. After the meeting, Greene engaged in a similar investing strategy to that of Paulson, which involved a series of unconventional investments trading [[credit default swaps]]. The return on Greene's investments ultimately saved his business, and put him on [[Forbes 400]] list.<ref name="Forbes 2008-10-6" />

==2010 US Senate campaign==
{{main|United States Senate election in Florida, 2010}}
On April 30, 2010, Greene announced his intention to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] seat held by [[George LeMieux]], saying, "I am an outsider, the only candidate who isn't a career politician. I've succeeded in the real world of hard work â€“ the others have only succeeded at running for political office after office."<ref name="Youtube 2010-4-29">{{Cite web |last=Greene |first=Jeff |date=2010-04-29 |title=Jeff Greene for Florida |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8fMwaoZfVk |access-date=2010-04-29 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Greene stated he would refuse campaign contributions from [[special interests]], and would limit individual donations to $100.<ref name="St Petersburg Times 2010-4-30" /> His platform focused on economic reforms and job creation.<ref name="St Petersburg Times 2010-4-30">{{Cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Adam |last2=Beth Reinhard |date=2010-05-01 |title=Billionaire Democrat Jeff Greene jumps into Florida Senate race |work=St. Petersburg Times |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/billionaire-democrat-jeff-greene-jumps-into-florida-senate-race/1091739 |access-date=2010-05-06}}</ref> 

Greene introduced his story and his campaign with a {{YouTube|6hYbnAcPMVk|sixty-second video}}.
Greene's campaign was endorsed by the ''[[Tallahassee Democrat]]'''s editorial board. The board commended Greene for his "edge and an energy that make him want to push beyond the usual talking points", remarking, "we like the toughness he would bring to the office".<ref>[http://www.tallahassee.com/article/20100807/OPINION01/8070307/Our-Opinion-Democratic-primary-Greene ''Tallahassee Democrat'' endorsement of Jeff Greene]</ref>

Greene's attempt to win the Democratic nomination was, however, unsuccessful; Rep. [[Kendrick Meek]] won the primary election before losing to Republican [[Marco Rubio]] in the November general election.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Greene married [[Chinese Australian]] real estate executive Mei Sze Chan, who is twenty years his junior in age.<ref name="Jason Horowitz" /><ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120036270913390155 Wall Street Journal: "In Beverly Hills, A Meltdown Mogul Is Living Large" By JONATHAN KARP] January 15, 2008</ref> Chan was an ethnic [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] refugee from [[Malaysia]] who first fled to [[Australia]] with her family before heading to [[New York City]] after college.<ref name="Mei Sze Chan and Jeff Greene">{{Cite news |last1=Sipher |first1=Devan |last2=Navarro |first2=Mireya |date=2007-11-04 |title=Mei Sze Chan and Jeff Greene |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/fashion/weddings/04vows.html}}</ref> In 2009, she gave birth to their first child, Malcolm.<ref>[http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/the-women-behind-the-men-who-would-be-floridas-senator/1112189 Tampa Bay Times: "The women behind the men who would be Florida's senator" By Cristina Silva] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424204219/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/the-women-behind-the-men-who-would-be-floridas-senator/1112189 |date=2013-04-24 }} August 1, 2010</ref> Greene and his wife now have three sons and live in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]].<ref name="PBPost 2010-4-23">{{Cite news |last=Miller |first=Kimberley |date=2010-04-23 |title=Monday Meeting with Jeff Greene, founder of Florida Sunshine Investments |work=The Palm Beach Post |publisher=Cox Media |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/money/monday-meeting-with-jeff-greene-founder-of-florida-610314.html |access-date=2010-05-06}}</ref> Greene was quoted as saying, "I just wish I had met Mei Sze 20 years ago.".<ref name="Jason Horowitz">{{Cite news |last=Horowitz |first=Jason |date=June 25, 2010 |title=Jeff Greene touts business savvy, outsider status in run for U.S. Senate seat |work=[[Washington Post]] |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/06/24/AR2010062406366.html |access-date=June 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Mei Sze Chan and Jeff Greene" />
