==Race history==

===Bristol Marathon===
The half-marathon had been preceded locally by the Bristol Marathon, which was first run in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bristol Marathon returns after 29 years|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14940365|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref> In 2014, a new marathon was launched in Bristol.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/featured/bristol-and-bath-marathon-set-2015-14473/ | work=Athletics Weekly | title=New marathon from Bristol to Bath set for 2015  | date=10 December 2014}}</ref> Organised by Go2Events, the [[Bristol + Bath Marathon]] follows much of the Bristol Half Marathon route before heading out of the city through [[South Gloucestershire]] and into [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] finishing at [[Royal Victoria Park, Bath|Royal Victoria Park]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bristolbathmarathon.com/everything-you-need-to-know/the-run/ | work=Bristol+Bath Marathon | title=Everything You Need To Know}}</ref> The inaugural event took place on 25 October 2015.

===Bristol Half Marathon===
The first Bristol [[Half Marathon]] was held in 1989, with just 1,000 runners competing. The event grew with 12,000 competitors in 2005, 15,000 in 2006 and 16,000 in 2009, a figure around which the participation level has settled.<ref>http://www.runbristol.com</ref>

Notable editions of the race include 1997, when the event was titled 'The Cabot 500 Run Through History' to celebrate the 500th anniversary of [[John Cabot]]'s first voyage to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1497 and 2001, when the Bristol Half Marathon was also the 10th [[IAAF]] [[2001 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships|World Half Marathon Championships]], and attracted competitors such as [[Haile Gebrselassie]] and [[Paula Radcliffe]].

In 2007 the race incorporated the [[UK Athletics]] team selection trial for the [[2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships]], as well as the [[Amateur Athletic Association]] championship half marathon.

The first fatality in the race occurred in 2011, when a male runner collapsed and died.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14866295 | work=BBC News | title=Bristol Half Marathon: Male runner dies | date=11 September 2011}}</ref>

The names of various sponsors have prefixed the title of the race in the past, with names including the [[BUPA]] Bristol Half Marathon, the [[Reebok]] Bristol Half Marathon and the Run Bristol Half Marathon, being sponsored by [[Bristol City Council]]. On 14 December 2015, it was announced from 2016 the event, alongside sister event the Bristol 10k, would be organised by [[Great Run]] and renamed the Great Bristol Half Marathon.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.greatrun.org/news-and-media/news/great-run-launches-two-new-events | work=Great Run | title=GREAT RUN LAUNCHES TWO NEW EVENTS | date=14 December 2015}}</ref>

In 2011 a business challenge was introduced, to stimulate participation by colleagues within Bristol companies.
