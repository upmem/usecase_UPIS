'''Kahn Fotuali'i''' (born 22 May 1982) is a [[Samoa]]n [[rugby union]] player for [[Montpellier Herault Rugby|Montpellier]] in the [[Top 14]]. He plays as a [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum-half]].

In 2002 he played with New Haven Rugby in the United States and led the club to a Division II national championship playing primarily at #10. In 2004, he debuted for [[Tasman Rugby Union|Nelson Bays]], who later merged with [[Tasman Rugby Union|Marlborough]] to form the [[Tasman Rugby Union]]. In 2008, he made his [[Crusaders (rugby)|Crusaders]] debut. Fotuali'i had a successful year in 2010 scoring five tries for the Crusaders and starting most games ahead of All Blacks halfback [[Andrew Ellis|Andy Ellis]] until he was suspended for breaking Crusaders protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/Kahn-Fotualii-suspended-by-the-Crusaders-for-a-protocol-breach/tabid/506/articleID/13473/Default.aspx|title=Kahn Fotuali'i suspended by the Crusaders for a protocol breach|website=Radiolive.co.nz|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref> However, from his impressive form on the field for the Crusaders many thought Fotuali'i would be very close to All Black selection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawkesbaytoday.co.nz/sport/news/rugby-no-pressure-but-kahn-is-macs-next-all-black/3916374/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717055854/http://www.hawkesbaytoday.co.nz/sport/news/rugby-no-pressure-but-kahn-is-macs-next-all-black/3916374/ |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2010 Fotuali'i chose to represent [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] for their 2010 end-of-year tour. He made his debut for them against [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] where he scored Samoa's only try to win the game 13-10 and was man of the match.

He signed a two-year deal with Welsh side Ospreys ahead of the 2011/12 season.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/12561/6833878/fotualii-opts-for-ospreys|title=Fotuali'i opts for Ospreys|work=Sky Sports|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref> He scored his first try for the Ospreys against Glasgow Warriors in a 20-26 defeat.

Early in 2013, he was still with Ospreys, but there was speculation that he might join another club in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/Ospreys-battle-Kahn-Fotuali-Liberty/story-17655839-detail/story.html|title=Swansea: The latest news, sport, what's on and business from Swansea and Gower|website=Thisissouthwales.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref> He rejected a new deal by the Ospreys and signed for [[Northampton Saints]] on 24 January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/9823945/Northampton-Saints-sign-Samoa-scrum-half-Kahn-Fotualii-from-Ospreys.html|title=Northampton Saints sign Samoa scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i from Ospreys|website=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref> In 2014 he started as Northampton beat Saracens to win the [[Premiership Rugby|Premiership]] final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/27590375|title=Premiership final: Saracens 20-24 Northampton Saints|date=31 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=24 March 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 2015/16 season, whilst at Northampton Saints it was rumoured that he had signed for another premiership team, [[Bath Rugby]]. At the Saints last game of the season, at Gloucester, this was confirmed.

On September 3, 2016 Kahn Fotuali'i made his [[Bath Rugby]] debut against his former [[Northampton Saints]] team, with Bath winning the match 18-14 at Northampton for the first time in 16 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/37221633|title=Premiership: Northampton Saints 14-18 Bath|website=BBC Sport|access-date=2016-09-05}}</ref>

On 28 June 2019, Fotuali'i signed a one-year contract to join French side [[Montpellier Herault Rugby|Montpellier]] in the [[Top 14]] for the 2019-20 season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.planetrugby.com/kahn-fotualii-swaps-bath-for-montpellier/|publisher=Planet Rugby|title=Kahn Fotuali’i swaps Bath for Montpellier|date=28 June 2019|accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>
