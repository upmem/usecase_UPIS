Tagged for notability since September, 2009, I can find no significant third-party coverage to establish the notability of this building.  I am unsure of the reliability of Ink Magazine, but I [[WP:AGF|assume good faith]] that it is reliable, but one RS doesn't cut it for me.

*'''Comment'''.  (1) The ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' is not a local Kansas City publication any more than a Philadelphia paper would be local for New York City: St Louis and KC are two distinct (and quite large) metro areas.  However, the mention in the cited source from St. Louis appears to be incidental.  (2) The Cowtown Computer Congress does show up in other hacker-friendly media, such as the websites of ''[[Make (magazine)|Make]]''[http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2009/02/opening-the-ungerground-lair-of-the.html] and [[NYC Resistor]][http://www.nycresistor.com/2009/01/17/help-the-cowtown-computer-congress-make-rent-win-a-brand-new-macbook/], but I am not sure if these mentions are substantial enough. (3) A [[hackerspace]] in a cave 85 feet below the surface of Kansas City is inherently interesting, but it's unclear if these are enough under [[WP:ORG]] and [[WP:GNG]].--[[User:Arxiloxos|Arxiloxos]] ([[User talk:Arxiloxos|talk]]) 16:10, 15 February 2011 (UTC)
**(1) Brain fart. Thanks for pointing that out. (3) Apparently not interesting enough for anyone to write about, though. --[[User:Pnm|Pnm]] ([[User talk:Pnm|talk]]) 01:21, 16 February 2011 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' not really seeing anything here or in the article that suggests this passes our [[WP:ORG]] guidelines.  Substantial coverage by reliable sources seems not to exist.
