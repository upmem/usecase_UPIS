{{short description|Italian mathematician}}
'''Roberto Marcolongo''' (August 28, 1862 in [[Rome]] – May 16, 1943 in Rome) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[mathematician]], known for his research in [[vector calculus]] and [[theoretical physics]].

He graduated in 1886, and later he was an assistant of [[Valentino Cerruti]] in Rome. In 1895 he became professor of [[Classical mechanics|rational mechanics]] at the [[University of Messina]]. In 1908 he moved to the [[University of Naples]], where he remained until retirement in 1935.

He worked on [[vector calculus]] together with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]], which was then known as "Italian notation". In 1906 he wrote an early work which used the [[spacetime|four-dimensional formalism]] to account for relativistic invariance under [[Lorentz transformation]]s.

In 1921 he published to [[Messina]] one of the first treaties on the special relativity and general, where he used the absolute differential calculus without coordinates, developed with Burali-Forti, as opposed to the absolute differential calculus with coordinates of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]].

He was a member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] and other Italian academies.
