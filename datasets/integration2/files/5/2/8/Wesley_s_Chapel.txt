'''Wesley's Chapel''' (originally the '''City Road Chapel''') is a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] church situated in the [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] area in the south of the [[London Borough of Islington]]. Opened in 1778, it was built under the direction of [[John Wesley]], the founder of the Methodist movement. The site is a place of worship and visitor attraction, incorporating the '''Museum of Methodism''' in its [[crypt]] and '''John Wesley's House''' next to the chapel. The chapel has been called "The [[Mother Church]] of World Methodism".<ref name="NHLE"/>

Along with the associated [[The Leys School|Leysian]] Mission, Wesley's Chapel is a [[Methodist Circuit|circuit]] of the London District of the Methodist Church. The chapel has an average Sunday [[church service|service]] attendance of about 440.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|title=Circuit Membership Statistics Summary October 2012|url=http://www.methodist.org.uk/downloads/stats-35-London-Membership-1213-0513.pdf|work=Statistics for Mission|publisher=Methodist Church in Britain|accessdate=25 December 2013}}</ref>

==History and architecture==
In 1776 Methodist leader [[John Wesley]] applied to the [[City of London]] for a site to build his new chapel and was granted an area of land on [[City Road]]. After raising funds from across the Connexion<ref name="Vickers">{{cite web |last1=Vickers |first1=John A |title=Wesley's Chapel, City Road, London |url=https://dmbi.online/index.php?do=app.entry&id=2945 |website=dmbi.online |publisher=A Dictionary of Methodism in Britain and Ireland |accessdate=12 June 2020}}</ref> the foundation stone for the chapel was laid on 21 April 1777. The architect was [[George Dance the Younger]], surveyor to the City of London, and the builder was Samuel Tooth, a member of the Foundery society. The chapel was formally opened with a service on 1 November 1778.<ref name="Vickers"/> The City Road Chapel was established to replace Wesley's earlier London chapel, [[the Foundery]],<ref name="history" /> where he first preached on 11 November 1739.<ref name=Timeline>{{cite web|title=Wesley's Chapel - timeline|url=http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/timeline.htm|website=Museum of Methodism|accessdate=14 November 2015}}</ref>

The building has [[Grade I listed]] status and is a fine example of [[Georgian architecture]],<ref name="NHLE">{{NHLE |num=1195538 |accessdate=22 January 2009}} </ref> although it has been altered and improved since it was built. For example, the original plain windows were replaced with [[stained glass]]. In 1864, the gallery was modernised, its front lowered and [[rake (theatre)|rake]]d seating installed.<ref name="Vickers"/> Around the gallery is motif in relief supposedly designed by Wesley: a dove with an olive branch in its beak encircled by a serpent following its own tail.<ref>{{cite AV media |title=This Great Light Life & Legacy of John Wesley |publisher=Spiral productions |year=2013 |type=video |via=YouTube |minutes=9 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJayDyM4r7M}}</ref> The [[Adam style]] ceiling was replaced by a replica following a fire in 1879.<ref name="Vickers"/>

Another major refurbishment of 1891 was carried out by Holloway Brothers, collaborating with the Methodist architect [[William Willmer Pocock]]. (There is a memorial stained glass window dedicated to Pocock.) The foundations were reinforced, the [[apse]] windows were enlarged to accommodate the stained glass, and new pews were installed.<ref name="Vickers"/> The pillars supporting the gallery were originally ships' masts donated by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], but these were replaced by French [[jasper]] pillars donated from Methodist churches overseas.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=History: Wesley's Chapel|url=http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/history.htm|publisher=Wesley's Chapel & Leysian Mission|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> Only the top section of the original three-decker [[pulpit]] survives.<ref name="Vickers"/> An [[Church organ|organ]] was installed in 1882 and the present organ in 1891; it was electrified in 1905 and in 1938 its pipes were moved to their present position at the rear of the gallery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/Virtual%20Chapel/organ.htm |title=Organ |publisher=Wesley's Chapel & Leysian Mission |date=2008 |accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>

The location of the [[chancel|sanctuary]] (including the original [[Communion table]] against the wall) in an apse behind the pulpit was common in the '[[Church architecture in England#The auditory church|auditory]]' churches of the 18th century, but few other examples survive today.<ref name="Vickers"/> The present sanctuary in front of the pulpit dates from restoration work in the 1970s.

The chapel is set within a cobbled courtyard off City Road, with the chapel at the furthest end and Wesley's house on the right. 

=== John Wesley's House === 
[[File:John Wesley's House Exterior.jpg|thumb|upright|Exterior of the house]]
John Wesley's House, a [[Georgian architecture|mid-Georgian]] [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouse]], was built in 1779 at the same time as the chapel.<ref name="Inwood2012">{{cite book|author=Stephen Inwood|title=Historic London: An Explorer's Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eflk15CDPiEC&pg=PA97|date=28 June 2012|publisher=Pan Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-75252-8|pages=97–|quote=It was also resolved to provide a separate residence for John Wesley, who had lived many years in an apartment above the Foundry. ...

He is commemorated by a [[blue plaque]] on the City Road frontage. This [[Grade I listed]] building is open to visitors as a [[historic house museum]]. It was built by Wesley and designed by [[George Dance the younger]], at that time the surveyor of the City of London. 

Wesley lived in the house for the last twelve years of his life and died in his bedroom. The house was also used to accommodate travelling preachers and their families. The household servants also lived on the premises. The house continued to be used for travelling preachers after Wesley's death until it was turned into a museum in the 1900s.

At the front of Wesley's House is a small [[physic garden]] which contains herbs mentioned in Wesley's book, ''The Primitive Physic''. It details ways in which common people could cure themselves using natural medicines as they couldn't afford a doctor. Wesley set up the first free dispensary in London giving out medical advice and remedies at his Foundery chapel.

The house is dressed with period furniture which shows what it would have been like when Wesley lived and died there, although the house would have mostly been painted in [[wikt:French grey|French grey]] rather than fancy wallpaper.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Wesley died on 2 March 1791. His tomb is in the garden at the rear of the chapel alongside the graves of six of his preachers, and those of his sister Martha Hall and his doctor and biographer, [[John Whitehead (physician)|Dr John Whitehead]].<ref name="Vickers"/><ref>{{Find a Grave|1937|John Wesley}}</ref> 

[[Statue of John Wesley, Shoreditch|A bronze statue of Wesley]] with the inscription "the world is my parish" stands at the entrance to the courtyard; created in 1891 by [[John Adams-Acton]], the sculpture is [[Grade II listed]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=England|first1=Historic|title=Statue of John Wesley in the forecourt of Wesley's Chapel, Islington - 1195540|url=http://www.historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1195540|website=www.historicengland.org.uk|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=6 September 2017}}</ref>

The site also houses one of the few surviving examples of a gentleman's convenience built by the sanitary engineer [[Thomas Crapper]] in 1891.<ref>{{cite news |title=Visit One Of London's Most Opulent Toilets |url=https://londonist.com/london/secret/visit-london-s-most-opulent-toilet |accessdate=4 February 2019 |work=[[Londonist]] |date=30 December 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

== The Leysian Mission ==
[[File:Leysian Mission building, City Road, EC1 - geograph.org.uk - 1087963.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Leysian Mission building, City Road]]
[[The Leys School]] was opened in [[Cambridge]] in 1875, two years after non-Anglicans were admitted to the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. It was intended to be "the Methodist [[Eton College|Eton]]". [[William Fiddian Moulton|Dr William Fiddian Moulton]], a biblical scholar and church leader, was its first headmaster.

The mission was started, in nearby [[Whitecross Street, London|Whitecross Street]], in 1886, by former pupils of the school who were concerned about the social and housing conditions in the [[East End of London]].<ref name="Leysian">{{cite web |title=Leysian Mission, London |url=https://dmbi.online/index.php?do=app.entry&id=1697 |website=dmbi.online |publisher=A Dictionary of Methodism in Britain and Ireland |accessdate=13 June 2020}}</ref> In 1904 the mission moved into purpose-built premises in Old Street, very near Wesley’s Chapel.<ref name="Leysian"/> It provided a medical mission, a "poor man’s lawyer", a relief committee, feeding programmes, meetings for men and women, and a range of services and musical activities.

After [[World War II]] and the arrival of the [[welfare state]] the mission disposed of the buildings. Strong links with the school remain and a scholarship allows a number of children from the city of London to attend the school as boarders. Wesley’s Chapel and the mission merged on [[Easter Day]] 1989.<ref>[http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/mission.htm "What is the Leysian Mission?" at wesleyschapel.org.uk]</ref>

== The chapel today ==
The chapel is home to a [[multicultural]] congregation with a membership of 439.<ref name="stats" /> It is a working church with daily prayer, Sunday [[Holy Communion]] services and several weekday services. It is known for its relatively "[[high church]]" sacramental [[liturgy]]. The [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] minister is [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] Jennifer Smith.<ref>{{cite web |title=Revd Dr Jen Smith |url=https://www.methodistlondon.org.uk/18-02-13 |website=London District of the Methodist Church {{!}} London, UK {{!}} Methodism |accessdate=4 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Wesley's Chapel is in a [[Local Ecumenical Partnership]] (LEP) with [[St Giles-without-Cripplegate|St Giles' Cripplegate]], its Anglican neighbour and shares close relationships with St Joseph's [[Roman Catholic Church]], St Anne's [[Lutheran Church]] and the [[Friends meeting house]] at [[Bunhill Fields]]. It has meeting rooms for other activities.<ref>[http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/about.htm  "What is Wesley's Chapel?" at wesleyschapel.org.uk/]</ref>

== Museum of Methodism ==
The Museum of Methodism, housed in the chapel's [[crypt]], contains artefacts and relics relating to Methodism, including several of Wesley's speeches and essays on theology, the "warmed heart" contemplative space", [[Thomas Coke (bishop)|Thomas Coke]]'s writing slope or desk and [[Donald Soper]]'s portable preaching stand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Museum of Methodism |url=http://www.wesleyschapel.org.uk/museum.htm |publisher=Wesley's Chapel & Leysian Mission |accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref><ref>"Museum of Methodism" leaflet, available at the Museum</ref> The museum was created in 1978 and was refurbished in 2014, with the last case being installed in early 2016 thanks to a generous donation.
