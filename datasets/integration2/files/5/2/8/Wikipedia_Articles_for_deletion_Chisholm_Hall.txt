===[[Chisholm Hall]]===

*'''Keep''': it is a real place. Somebody might want be looking through Wikipedia for info on it. [[User:Where|Where]] [[User talk:Where|(talk)]] 18:02, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge into [[UTSA#Housing]] and delete'''. --[[User:Aaron|Aaron]] 18:25, 4 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge and delete''' per [[User:Aaron|Aaron]].  Colleges/houses at places with a residential system (Yale/Harvard/Oxford/Cambridge) are one thing; this is another.  Anyone who wants to find out information about housing at UTSA would be better off looking at [[UTSA#Housing]].  --[[User:Kinu|Kinu]] 18:31, 4 February 2006 (UTC)

Some sort of  Merge and disambiguate may be in order. (Disambiguation lonks should lead to the schools, not the buildings). [[User:Dsmdgold|Dsmdgold]] 15:30, 7 February 2006 (UTC)
*'''Merge'''.  The disambig would not be appropriate. [[User:Peyna|Peyna]] 02:44, 9 February 2006 (UTC)
