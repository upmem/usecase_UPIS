'''''Tatbir''''' ({{lang-ar|تطبير}}), also known as '''[[Talwar]] zani''' and '''Qama Zani''' in [[South Asia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pasbaaneaza.com/Fatawa_qama_zani.html |title=Fatwa on Tatbir [Qama Zani] |publisher=Pasbaan-e-Aza |accessdate=2010-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910063717/http://www.pasbaaneaza.com/Fatawa_qama_zani.html |archivedate=September 10, 2009 }}</ref> is a form of ritual bloodletting, practiced as an act of mourning by some [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Muslim]]s (it is a forbidden act according to some Grand Ayatollahs), for the younger grandson of [[Muhammad]], [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was killed along with his children, companions and near relatives at the [[Battle of Karbala]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph]] [[Yazid I]]. The practice was first introduced by the [[Qizilbash]] tribe who were instrumental in establishing the [[Safavid]] rule.<ref> [https://www.google.com/search?q=tatbir+Qizilbash&oq=tatbir+Qizilbash&aqs=chrome..69i57j33l2.6516j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#]</ref> Tatbir is a contested issue among Shia. Most clerics deem it to be [[self-harm]] and hence [[haram]]. However, a small minority of Shia do perpetuate the practice in defiance.

==Performance of Tatbir==
Tatbir is practiced by some Shia Muslims on the 10 [[Muharram]] of the [[Islamic calendar]], known as "the [[Day of Ashura]]", and on the 40th day after Ashura, Known as "[[Arba'een]]/Chehelom" by [[Twelvers]] around the world. Some Shia may also perform tatbir on other occasions as well.

The practice of Tatbir includes striking oneself with a form of a ''talwar'' "sword" on the head, causing blood to flow in remembrance of the innocent blood of Imam Husayn. Some Twelvers also hit their back and/or chest with blades attached to chains.

==Fatwas==
Tatbir are contested among Shia clerics. While some traditionalist clerics allow believers to indulge in tatbir, modernist clerics deem it impermissible because it is considered self-harm, thus [[haram]] in Islam.<ref name="MonsuttiNaef2007">{{cite book|last1=Monsutti|first1=Alessandro|last2=Naef|first2=Silvia|last3=Sabahi|first3=Farian|title=The Other Shiites: From the Mediterranean to Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_62A00tLaygC&pg=PA146|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03911-289-0|pages=146–|accessdate=2015-09-30}}</ref> Most religious authorities associate all forms of self-flagellation and blood-letting as ways to relate to painful deaths during the battle of Karbala by [[Imam Husayn]] and supporters.<ref name="YasserSabrina2014">{{cite book|author1=Tabbaa, Yasser|author2=Mervin, Sabrina|title=Najaf, the Gate of wisdom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cdPeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|date=28 July 2014|publisher=UNESCO|isbn=978-92-3-100028-7|pages=154–}}</ref>

== Criticisms ==
* Tatbir is a mourning ceremony that calls for self-flagellation and consequent blood shedding. At the ceremony, mourners strike themselves with [[daggers]]/blades on their head and other parts of their body. It is considered unsanitary as blood introduced into environment through open wounds of mourners can carry dangerous diseases.
* Tatbir can also cause disturbances in the mental balance of people of society gathering to view it.<ref name="Tatbir">{{cite web|last1 = |first1 = |title = Tatbir|url = http://tatbir.org/|website = Tatbir.org|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Masaeli|first1=Mahdi|title=Tatbir|url=http://www.fetan.ir/home/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/%DA%A9%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%82%D9%85%D9%87-%D8%B2%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AA-%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%B9%D8%AA-Fetan.ir_.pdf|website=Fetan|publisher=Golban Publication}}</ref>
* There are different opinion about the practice of Tatbir. [[Shia]] believes that it is a form of self-harm, so it must be forbidden. Others who practice Tatbir consider it as "folk practice". According to some sects of Shia, it is felt Tatbir reflects on Shia observers poorly, so they typically avoid it in a region where [[Sunni]]s also reside. Abbas Shams al-Din, a Shia cleric, said: "these practices used to be limited and no one paid attention to them, but they have started to spread and defame the image of the event in a huge way."<ref name="Nytimes">{{cite news | first=Ben | last=Hubbard | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/world/middleeast/bloody-and-belittled-shiite-ritual-draws-historic-parallels-in-iraq.html?_r=0 | title=Bloody and Belittled Shiite Ritual Draws Historic Parallels | accessdate=<!-- November 2014 --> | newspaper=[[The New York Times Company]]| date=2014-11-05 }}</ref>
* [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] sociologist [[Ibrahim al-Haidari]] has called Tatbir an irrational act. He states blood donations should replace Tatbir.
