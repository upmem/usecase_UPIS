In economics, the '''Backus–Kehoe–Kydland consumption correlation puzzle''', also known as the '''BKK puzzle''', is the observation that [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] is much less [[correlation|correlated]] across countries than [[Output (economics)|output]].
==Statement==
In an [[Arrow–Debreu model|Arrow–Debreu economy]], i.e. an economy with a [[Complete market|complete set of state-contingent markets]], country-specific output risks should be pooled and domestic consumption growth should not depend heavily on country-specific income shocks.  So according to theory we should observe that consumption is much more correlated across countries than output.  What [[David K. Backus|Backus]], [[Patrick J. Kehoe|Kehoe]] and [[Finn Kydland|Kydland]] found in their article from 1992 was the opposite, namely that consumption is much less correlated across countries than output.<ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1992">{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Kehoe | first2 = Patrick J.| last3 = Kydland | first3 = Finn E. | year=1992 |title= International Real Business Cycles | journal = [[Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 100 | pages = 745–775 | doi = 10.1086/261838 | issue = 4| url = http://minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr146.pdf}}</ref><ref name="BackusKehoeKydland1995">{{Citation | last= Backus  | first= David K.  | last2= Kehoe  | first2= Patrick J.  | last3= Kydland  | first3= Finn E.  | year= 1995  | editor-last= Cooley  | editor-first= Tom  | editor-link = Thomas F.

Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) calculate the correlation of [[Hodrick–Prescott filter|HP-filtered]] consumption and output for 11 advanced countries relative to the US. The measured average consumption correlation was .19, whereas the average output correlation was .31. [[Maurice Obstfeld|Obstfeld]] and [[Kenneth Rogoff|Rogoff]] (1996)<ref name="ObstfeldRogoff1996">{{Citation  | last= Obstfeld  | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 1996  | title= Foundations of International Macroeconomics  | publisher= The MIT Press  | isbn= 978-0-262-15047-7  | url-access= registration  | url= https://archive.org/details/foundationsofint0000obst  }}</ref>  reports average correlation of OECD countries with world consumption (35 “benchmark” countries) of .43, whereas the average OECD country’s output correlation with world benchmark is 0.52. The really puzzling part of these results is not that consumption levels are not perfectly correlated, but that they are less correlated than output.  Apparently, there is hardly any risk sharing.

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000) identifies this as one of the six major puzzles in international economics.<ref name="ObstfeldRogoff2000">{{Citation  | last= Obstfeld   | first= Maurice  | last2= Rogoff  | first2= Kenneth  | year= 2000  | editor-last= Bernanke

It is also related to the [[Backus-Smith puzzle|Backus-Smith consumption-real exchange rate puzzle]].<ref name="BackusSmith92">{{citation | last1 = Backus | first1 = David K.| last2 = Smith| first2 = Gregor W.| year=1993 |title= Consumption and real exchange rates in dynamic economies with non-traded goods | journal =Journal of International Economics | volume = 35| pages = 297–316 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1996(93)90021-O | issue = 3–4| url = https://www.econ.queensu.ca/sites/econ.queensu.ca/files/qed_wp_1252.pdf}}</ref>

== Attempts to account for the perceived anomaly ==
Stockman and [[Linda Tesar|Tesar]] (1995)<ref name="StockmanTeser1995">{{citation | last1 = Stockman | first1 = Alan C.| last2 = Tesar | first2 = Linda L. |authorlink2=Linda Tesar | year=1995 |title= Tastes and Technology in a Two-Country Model of the Business Cycle: Explaining International Comovements | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 85 | pages = 168–185 | issue=1 | jstor=2118002}}</ref> suggests two means of breaking the link between prices and quantities and making it hard for households to smooth consumption by trade.  The first is nontraded goods: Suppose households like to consume goods that cannot be traded, like some services. If there is a positive technology shock raising their supply, they can’t [[consumption smoothing|smooth their consumption]] of these goods by exporting them abroad.  The second is "taste shocks": If consumption rises in one country without any change in the economic environment, it will borrow abroad, driving up the interest rate and inducing the foreign country to cut back on its consumption. So consumption could be negatively correlated across countries.
