'''''Just Shapes & Beats''''' is an [[Action game|action]] [[rhythm game|rhythm]] [[video game]] developed and published by Canadian<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/berzerkstudio |title=Berzerk Studio (@berzerkstudio) |website=[[Twitter]] |accessdate=July 7, 2019}}</ref> indie team Berzerk Studio. It was released on May 31, 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Nintendo Switch]], February 24, 2019 for [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], May 10, 2019 for [[PlayStation 4]] in the US, and May 30, 2019 for [[PlayStation 4]] in Europe, Russia and Australia. It was also released on June 30, 2020 for [[Google Stadia|Stadia]]. In this game, players move a colorful shape to the beat of background music and dodge pink shapes.

== Gameplay ==
Up to four players each control one small [[shape]], surviving attacks simply by dodging against a variety of attacks, such as huge beams, bouncing hills, snake-like spirals, and pulsating shapes. These attacks appear, move, and attack in rhythm to the music, with difficulty increasing the further players progress.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/review-just-shapes-beats-506246.phtml|title=Review: Just Shapes & Beats|website=destructoid|language=english|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>

The rhythm visually manifests on-screen as all manner of objects, of different patterns and sizes, distinguishable by their pink color, that must be dodged until the track ends. Getting struck by one of these attacks causes the player to lose part of their shape, represented by either a cyan [[square]], a yellow [[triangle]], a green [[pentagon]] or an orange [[circle]], if there are multiple players. If the shape breaks entirely, the game rewinds to the previous checkpoint. Three breaks within a single level results in a Game Over screen, with the text stating "It's Over" and the cyan square breaking down to pieces. Tapping Enter (PC/Steam), A (Switch), or the Cross button (PS4) multiple times causes the square to fix itself and changes the screen's text to read "It's NOT Over", allowing the player to continue from the beginning of the level.

Hardcore mode was added in 2019, which adds the harder versions of all available levels.<ref name=":0" />

''Just Shapes & Beats'' offers multiple modes that feature variations on the basic gameplay, such as party mode, playlist, challenge run, and a story mode.

== Development ==

The first demo of the game was revealed at [[PAX (event)|PAX]] 2016 and was supposed to be released that summer. During the event, release date was delayed from late 2016 to early 2017.<ref name="destructoidarticle">{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/just-shapes-beats-is-stressful-chaotic-and-i-absolutely-love-it-357266.phtml|title=Just Shapes & Beats is stressful, chaotic, and I absolutely love it|last=McAloon|first=Alissa|date=April 23, 2016|website=[[Destructoid]]|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref> The game was eventually delayed again, with a launch date of summer 2018.
