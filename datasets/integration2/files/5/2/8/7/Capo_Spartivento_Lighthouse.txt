The structure is situated in the municipality of [[Domus de Maria]].

==Description==
The lighthouse was built in 1866 and consists of a masonry cylindrical tower, {{convert|19|m|ft}} high, with balcony and lantern rising from a 2-storey keeper's house. The building, painted in red with white trim, was in poor condition and was restored in 2006 and transformed into a luxury resort, with four suites and swimming pool, as the adjacent building. The tower is painted white and the lantern, which mounts a Type OR T3 optics with a [[Focal length]] of 125mm, in grey metallic. The light is positioned at {{convert|81|m|ft}} [[above sea level]] and emits [[Light characteristic#Class of light|two white flashes]] in a 10 seconds period visible up to a distance of {{convert|22|nmi}}. The lighthouse is completely automated and managed by the [[Marina Militare]] with the identification code number 1310 E.F.<ref name=marinaspartivento/>
