'''Globe Rowing Club''' is a [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] club in [[Greenwich]], an area in the South East of London, England. Established in 1923, the club house and boat house are based on Crane Street in the historic centre of Greenwich, as part of the Trafalgar Rowing Trust.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.curlewrowingclub.co.uk/about-us/history/|title=Curlew Rowing Club – History}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trafalgarrowingcentre.co.uk/globe-rowing-club/|title=Trafalgar Rowing Trust website}}</ref> The club uses both the [[River Thames]] and the [[London Regatta Centre]] at the [[Royal Docks]] for water outings, and admits male and female rowers of all ages, but is particularly known for its high performance Junior programme.

== History ==
The rowing club was originally established at [[J. Stone & Co]]'s engineering works in [[Deptford]]'s Arklow Road and was called Stones Rowing Club, with membership restricted to company employees.<ref name=history>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globerowingclub.co.uk/club/history|title=Globe Rowing Club History}}</ref>

In the first years after the club was established, the boats used were heavy Clinker fours,<ref>{{cite book|last=Rackley|first=Adam|title=Salt, Sweat, Tears: The Men Who Rowed the Oceans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTXyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT34|year=2014|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-241-96704-1|page=34}}</ref> hired from local [[Waterman (occupation)|waterman]] in East Greenwich and were used mainly on Sunday mornings. This was found to be cost prohibitive and, in time, the club applied to Stone's engineering works for a grant to purchase new equipment. This was refused, and as a result the club broke away from the works and set up independently to attract new members from elsewhere, with headquarters in the nearby Lord Clyde public house (western end of Clyde Street). The club was hence known as the Clyde Rowing Club.

During the mid 1930s, the headquarters were moved to another public house, The Globe on Royal Hill in [[Greenwich, London|Greenwich]] (demolished c. 1938), from which the rowing club took its current name, Globe Rowing Club. The club also had a headquarters (1947) at the nearby [[The Mitre, Greenwich|Mitre]] public house in Greenwich;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d9c36e95-a-52ef4160-s-sites.googlegroups.com/a/globerowingclub.co.uk/globerowingclub/club/history/crouch-4s-1947.jpg?attachauth=ANoY7cpbDRlpEvFyVHsSADFi5cs8NE2N6NZHtItg8cAEPk2sbY15NW51jscY5FfJ0QKzv4YSrhZMokaxJvJhI_wZrFE98lZ04NG6h4_yorbQfhvq1bDDa904TqpQ2TcVsFXuwtNdW81ROrSUe5MpiEqDeJ1ctyNtbEtuNcJAzHuCmzBrS1piMhWl4cfOmkWLgMnM-OVMzlTRmbFJbgaCuEXx6sf_mKQLjPnpIOPULbyws0lcy9DfzCT8gAuTsoDcK0B-YyK4vI7l&attredirects=0|title=Globe Rowing Club Crouch Fours Programme}}</ref> and for a time used a decommissioned landing craft moored opposite the Union Tavern (today [[Cutty Sark (pub)|The Cutty Sark]]) at Ballast Quay.<ref name=history/>

Globe was only the second club in East London after [[Curlew Rowing Club]] to hold club regattas, with the earliest taking place shortly after the end of the Second World War, the participants being watermen working on nearby Thames shuttles and barges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/feature/place-i-love-riverfront-greenwich|title=Civil Service World – Globe Rowing background}}</ref> The club was also the first [[Rowing on the River Thames|rowing club in East London]] to use an [[Eight (rowing)|eight]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globerowingclub.co.uk/club/history/eight|title=Globe Rowing Club Eight}}</ref>

In August 1981, members of Globe Rowing Club set a Guinness World Record for "The greatest distance for paddling a hand propelled bath tub in 24 hr...by a team of 25" The record distance set was "60 miles 88 yd".<ref>{{cite book|last1=McWhirter|first1=Norris|last2=Matthews|first2=Peter|title=Guinness book of records|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessbookofr00mcwh|url-access=registration|year=1983|publisher=Guinness Superlatives|isbn=978-0-85112-260-1}}</ref>

In 2006, Greenwich Council granted permission, with contributions from [[Sport England]], and the Trafalgar 2001 Trust Ltd for the club to develop the facilities on the corner of Crane Street and Eastney Street, creating a heated, lit boathouse, indoor training room and clubhouse known as the Trafalgar Rowing Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishrowing.org/upload/files/StudentJunior/Teachers/CaseStudies/Spotlight-Greenwich.pdf?41e6e6|title=Greenwich Rowing Case Study}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trafalgarrowingcentre.co.uk/|title=Trafalgar Rowing Centre}}</ref>

In the early 2010s, Globe's Junior section began a partnership with non-profit organisation [[London Youth Rowing]], to bring indoor and water rowing to increase participation in the sport and allow those from disadvantaged backgrounds to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.londonyouthrowing.com/our-mission-and-vision|title=London Youth Rowing Mission statement}}</ref> Many of the junior members who have gone on to achieve national and international rowing success have done so as a result of the partnership with LYR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://werow.co.uk/youth-rowing-julia-olawumi-of-globe-rowing-club/|title=Youth Rowing}}</ref>
