The result was '''Delete'''. The author apparently will merge the info, so I'll make the info available to him/her. [[User:The_undertow|''the_undertow'']] [[User_talk:The_undertow|<font style="color:5bf8a9"><small><sup>talk</sup></small></font>]] 23:51, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

This academic seems to fail [[WP:PROF]]. He is a ''ricercatore'' at the University of Genoa (that corresponds roughly to [[lecturer]] in the UK system). As such he would certainly not be inherently notable. Other clear claims to notability were missing, so I added a PROD. The PROD was contested by the original author, and Barbucci was suddenly promoted to "professor" (on the wiki page, not at the university, as can be seen [http://www.unige.it/staff/persone/rdn/SQYNDVNEBwYKAEA= here]). The article was expanded with more vague claims to notability, but none seems to be substantial enough for meeting [[WP:PROF]]. (His institution does not make him notable, nor does the fact that he lectures and publishes scientific papers - that's just the normal work of a researcher.) -- Sent here as part of the [[WP:WPNN|Notability wikiproject]]. --[[User:B.

'''Modification coming today'''
Barbucci's article will be immediately downgraded and rolled into a new article on the high temperature fuel cells research unit "Genoa Joint Laboratories."  Thanks for the guidance, no intent to mislead the public. <small>—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Swilliams10|Swilliams10]] ([[User talk:Swilliams10|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Swilliams10|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}</small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

*'''comment''' intended merge target [[Genoa Joint Laboratories]] has since been created (and tagged as CSD A7 four minutes later [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genoa_Joint_Laboratories&diff=172131317&oldid=172130726]).  I suggest waiting a week on both these articles before passing judgement on notability. [[User:Pete.Hurd|Pete.Hurd]] ([[User talk:Pete.Hurd|talk]]) 19:44, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
*'''Keep and Merge''' I don't this he does fails [[WP:PROF]. Rolling into [[Genoa Joint Laboratories]] would be a good idea. [[User:Scope creep|scope_creep]] ([[User talk:Scope creep|talk]]) 20:59, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
**'''Comment''' The [[Genoa Joint Laboratories]] article is a mess, and is up for speedy, although it is a valid article.   [[User:Scope creep|scope_creep]] ([[User talk:Scope creep|talk]]) 21:01, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
*'''Merge''' as per the author's suggestion.  Though I wouldn't ascribe any dubious motives to the changing of "ricercatore" to "professor."  Since ricercatore isn't an English word it is often translated.  And (in America at least) professor (esp. with a lowercase p) is a common translation for the word.  In fact, translating the Italian "professore" to "professor" in English is often a worse slip, since the former can include all school teachers.  -- [[User:Mscuthbert|Myke Cuthbert]] <small>[[User_talk:Mscuthbert|(talk)]]</small> 23:46, 17 November 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete.''' I'd have no objection to re-creation if the 'Bibliography' section of his article could be filled in with some of his important papers. Saying that he has 80 peer-reviewed publications doesn't cut it if our article gives no pointers to them. I'd oppose merging to our [[Genoa Joint Laboratories]] article because it's still a mess.  Either this article should be fixed, and become informative, or the [[Genoa Joint Laboratories]] article should become informative. So long as neither of them is helpful, I see no reason to keep or merge. His own web site was not useful. My web research went in circles; his important work was always just around the corner, but I never found it.

*'''Delete''' [[Web of Science]] lists several publications, but the most-cited one has been mentioned only 21 times and only a total of 170 articles cited this researcher. That  is not very impressive at all and does not indicate that his peers would consider him notable. --[[User:Crusio|Crusio]] ([[User talk:Crusio|talk]]) 09:15, 19 November 2007 (UTC)
