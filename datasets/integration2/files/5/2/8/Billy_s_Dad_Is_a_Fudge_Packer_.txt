'''''Billy's Dad is a Fudge-Packer!''''' is a 2004 American black-and-white [[short film|short]] [[comedy film]] written and directed by [[Jamie Donahue]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=David |title=Billy's Dad is a Fudge-Packer |url=http://www.gaycelluloid.com/search/172.htm |website=Gay Celluloid |accessdate=21 September 2020}}</ref> in her first non-acting effort. It is a parody of the 1950s [[social guidance film]]s, and depicts the life of a boy learning about adulthood in a traditional family. The apparently innocent account of family life in the 1950s is loaded with [[sexual innuendo]]. It was made by production company [[POWER UP]].

==Plot==
Billy is a boy who has to decide what he will do with his life. His father works at the candy factory as a "fudge packer" (which is modern slang for a man who performs [[homosexual]] [[anal sex]]) and "has several men under him". His mother is visited by a short, mannish woman who knows how to please the local housewives. His sister is preparing to be a good wife, and in almost every shot is moving a phallic object to her mouth.
