* What the heck is this... Lets '''delete''' until there are some sources. ---[[User:J.smith|J.S]]  <small>([[User_talk:J.smith|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/J.smith|C]]/[[WP:WRE|WRE]])</small> 02:16, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - this is very amusing, but I don't see any sources which support notability here.  --[[User:Haemo|Haemo]] 03:42, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Plenty of Bra Days out there, but this one doesn't exist.  Hoax. [[User:Darkspots|Darkspots]] 09:59, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Speedy Delete''' Not Notable and smells like a hoax espically without Sources. --[[User:St.daniel|<font color="teal">''St.daniel''</font>]] <sup>[[User talk:St.daniel|<font color="purple">talk</font>]]</sup> 12:00, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. No "Swedish lingerie company" = hoax. [[User:BTLizard|BTLizard]] 12:25, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''.  Hoax. ---[[User:Theoldanarchist|Charles]] 16:00, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - maybe a hoax, maybe not, doesn't matter. It's just non-notable promotion. [[User:Moreschi|Moreschi]] <sup> [[User talk:Moreschi|Talk]]</sup> 17:41, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - whether or not it's a hoax is irrelevant, this is a piece of OR about an even that doesn't even happen any more and even when it happened was only "an annual event to a few of the most die-hard yay-D-bra customers". Such events [http://www.walkthewalk.org/events/moonwalk/faq.htm do exist] but I can't see why this particular one's of any note<font face="Trebuchet MS"> -  [[User:Iridescenti|<font color="orangered">'''irides'''</font><font color="darkviolet">'''centi'''</font>]] [[User_talk:Iridescenti|<small><font color="chocolate"><i>(talk to me!)</i></font></small>]]</font> 17:47, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No Google hits for Yay-D-Bra (except this AFD) renders this at the least non-notable original research and very possibly a hoax.
