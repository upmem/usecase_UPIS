This looks like a hoax, given the lack of citations and the user's previous content, which all appear to be hoaxes as well. Despite being published by Viz Media according to the infobox, I find no indication that Viz even knows what Koden is, let alone publish it on a weekly basis. Might qualify for Speedy Deletion under A7 as the article doesn't actually assert any notability or G11 as [[User:Majinsharingan]] seems to be the only one to edit the article aside from a DAB toplink placed by another user.Cheers, [[user:Lankybugger|Lankybugger]] ○ [[User_talk:Lankybugger|Yell]] ○ 00:34, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' - sounds like gibberish.  Leave a redirect to [[Kodeń]] though. [[User:Balcer|Balcer]] 18:33, 24 April 2007 (UTC)
