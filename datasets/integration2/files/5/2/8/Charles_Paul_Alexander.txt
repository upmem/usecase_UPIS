'''Charles Paul Alexander''' (September 25, 1889, [[Gloversville, New York]] - December 3, 1981) was an American [[Entomology|entomologist]] who specialized in the craneflies, [[Tipulidae]].

Charles Paul Alexander was the son of Emil Alexander and Jane Alexander (née Parker). Emil (the father) immigrated to the United States in 1873 and changed his surname from Schlandensky to Alexander. Charles entered [[Cornell University]] in 1909, earning a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1913 and a Ph.D. in 1918. Between 1917 and 1919, he was entomologist at the [[University of Kansas]], then from 1919 to 1922, at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]].

He then became professor of entomology at [[Massachusetts Agricultural College]] at [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]]. He studied [[Diptera]], especially in the family [[Tipulidae]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles P.

In 1920, C.P. Alexander became a Fellow of the [[Entomological Society of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoc.org/awards/honors/fellows_list|title=List of ESA Fellows|publisher=Entomological Society of America|accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref>
