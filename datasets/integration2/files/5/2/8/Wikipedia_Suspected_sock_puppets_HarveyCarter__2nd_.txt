;Evidence
User HaveyCarter and JohnRobertsly already confirmed sockpuppets [[Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/HarveyCarter]] could not reopen HarveyCarter case. 3 new usernames have made similar and exact edits like JohnRobertsly -
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&diff=prev&oldid=124394655] -vs- Granville1 edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&diff=next&oldid=125330268]


articles edited by Rogersleigh [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Rogersleigh] almost identical to ones by Granville1 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Granville1]

which both link back to JohnRobertsly's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JohnRobertsly]

Also all 4 accounts have had the habit of not signing their posts on a regular basis. (the newest one does, thoug by now has to have read this and sees that fact) The first 4 accounts have gotten in trouble for posting quite inflaming things about both living and dead celebrities. By thier contributions almost all the same group. 

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Connery&diff=124896938&oldid=124896766] edits in the Sean Connery retirement section then [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indiana_Jones_4&diff=prev&oldid=125334566] Granville1 says this in a related article

All 5 accounts have made VERY similar edits and comments in the John Wayne article and especially its talk page.

Here the known sockpuppet acct JohnRobertsly makes a comment in the talk page of Jimmy Stewart [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:James_Stewart_%28actor%29&diff=113124254&oldid=113068021] and later Granville1 makes the same comment [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:James_Stewart_%28actor%29&diff=125224329&oldid=124353329]

here JohnRobertsly says on the Steve McQueen talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Steve_McQueen&diff=prev&oldid=124390123] here Rogersleigh tries to put in almost the exact same statment days later in the article itself [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_McQueen&diff=prev&oldid=124847684] then Granville1 tries to put the EXACT same statement in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_McQueen&diff=prev&oldid=125447640]

Another linking of the original sockpuppet account HarveyCarter with the newer names [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Wayne&diff=prev&oldid=102913528]
HarveyCarter kept trying to put this in over and over when discussion page said it was very pov and recently [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Wayne&diff=prev&oldid=124840098] Rogersleigh put the same thing in after a long absence. 

More unsigned comments (habit of all 4 accounts) saying practically the same things [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&diff=125446723&oldid=125433061] by Granville1 and by Rogersleigh [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&diff=124893853&oldid=124847150] 

a couple accounts share an apparent hate of Mel Gibson so far as to say the same thing about him in different places on the Talk:We Were Soldiers Granville1 makes the comments [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:We_Were_Soldiers&diff=prev&oldid=125336685] then recently on the Talk:Mel Gibson page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mel_Gibson&diff=125589243&oldid=124980218] the newest account Gibsonism makes strikingly similar wishes dealing with cancer. (also violation of WP:BLP). In fact Gibsonism's next edit is almost word for word like the Granville1 we were soldiers edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mel_Gibson&diff=next&oldid=125589243] (it to a violation of WP:BLP)

Gibsonism makes this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:John_Wayne&diff=125554898&oldid=125554344] just like JohnRobertsly a few days ago [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:John_Wayne&diff=123026197&oldid=122500850]

Plenty more just click all 5 accounts contributions

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Stewart_%28actor%29&diff=prev&oldid=125449688] edit of Granville1 vs [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:James_Stewart_%28actor%29&diff=prev&oldid=125559143] 

;Comments

Looks like originally HarveyCarter had an account - got blocked for malicious text against celebrities both past and present. Then made an account of JohnRobertsly was shown in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Suspected_sock_puppets/HarveyCarter] to be the same account due to articles edited, not signing, very similar and identical edits. Now a few days later Rogersleigh starts an account using a similar type username then the edits come out some as seen above the almost the same as the previous proved sock puppets. Then they stop, then Granville1 starts they edit the same pages and as shown above make almost identical posts on talk pages of the same articles as the other 3 accounts. Even using the same terms. All 4 accounts are of the same blocked original user HarveyCarter. I had to open another case using the one of the new names due to the fact I can't reopen the HarveyCarter one. Added 4/24 Granville1 was blocked and immediately after Gibsonism was created and is making the exact same edits to the same articles now. Making the same statements slightly changed, one can take that pattern as he has seen what has gotten the previous accounts in trouble. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Gibsonism] Their newest account.
