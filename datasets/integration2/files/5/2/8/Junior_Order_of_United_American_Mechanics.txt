The '''Junior Order of United American Mechanics''' is an American [[fraternal order]]. It began as a youth affiliation of the [[Order of United American Mechanics]], but seceded to become its own organization and eventually absorbed its parent order. Originally, it was an [[anti-Catholic]], [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] group, but eventually abandoned this position and became a general fraternal benefit society open to people regardless of creed, race or sex.<ref>Alvin J. Schmidt and Nicholas Babchuk,''Fraternal Organizations'' Greenwood Press Westport, CT, 1980 p.171-2</ref>

In 1923 the JOUAM had 253,399 members in its "Funeral Benefit Dept" and 22,519 "Beneficiary Degree" members. Its headquarters at that time were located at 741 Wabash Building, and reportedly had state and local councils in nearly every state in the Union. It also ran a [[Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans' Home (Tiffin, Ohio)|home for the orphans of deceased members]] in [[Tiffin, Ohio]], which housed 800-900 children. While the Order's purposes were mostly fraternal by this point, membership remained restricted to Protestants, and some of its officers still continued to advocate anti-Catholic positions.<ref>Preuss, Arthur ''A Dictionary of Secret and other Societies'' St. Louis: B. Herder Book Co. 1924; republished Detroit: Gale Reference Company 1966; p.208</ref>

By 1969 this had dwindled to 35,172, 15,000 of which were social (non-insured) members. By 1979 the number had dropped to 8,500, evenly divided between social and beneficiary members in 400 local councils. The group was then headquartered in [[Willow Grove, Pennsylvania|Willow Grove]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] and held a national convention biennially. It also had a [[bimonthly]] news paper, ''Junior American'',<ref>Schmidt p.172</ref> which is still published.<ref>http://www.jrouam.org/index.php?pr=Junior_American&=SID</ref>

Between 1925 and 1932, they constructed the [[Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans Home (Lexington, North Carolina)|Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans Home]] near [[Lexington, North Carolina]].<ref name = nrhpinv>{{Cite web | author = Ruth Little| title =Junior Order United American Mechanics National Orphans Home| work = National Register of Historic Places - Nomination and Inventory | date = August 1983 | url = https://files.nc.gov/ncdcr/nr/DV0506.pdf | publisher = North Carolina State Historic Preservation Office | accessdate = 2014-10-01}}</ref> It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>
