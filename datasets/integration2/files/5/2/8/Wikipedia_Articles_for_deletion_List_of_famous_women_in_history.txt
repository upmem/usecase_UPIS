===[[List of famous women in history]]===
Completing a nomination. Rationale was given as edit summary: "Nominated for deletion. Absurdly general, very presence of article (segregated from other Famous Figures in History) gives credence to male chauvanism." No !vote from me. ([[User:Paolo Liberatore|Liberatore]], [[User talk:Paolo Liberatore|2006]]). 15:40, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - either unmaintainable or [[WP:NPOV|non-neutral point of view]]. [[User:Yomangani|<span style="font-family:Verdana;color:#0000ee">Yomangani</span>]][[User_talk:Yomangani|<sup>talk</sup>]] 16:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' Criteria for inclusion far too vague and subjective and is extremely broad. [[User:Agent 86|Agent 86]] 21:23, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. This would draw out many POV issues. Famous can mean different things for different people. --[[User:Nishkid64|<span style="color:red">'''Nish'''</span><span style="color:blue">'''kid'''</span><span style="color:green">'''64'''</span>]] 23:16, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' List definition is too broad - would contain an unmanageable amount of entries [[User:Bwithh|Bwithh]] 00:56, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. Too broad a criteria. Could have thousands of names -- and what does "famous" mean, really... [[User:23skidoo|23skidoo]] 13:09, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Do not delete'''. Please leave it--debate criteria if you will, but it's a very useful resource for educators. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:68.42.141.76|68.42.141.76]] ([[User talk:68.42.141.76|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/68.42.141.76|contribs]]) </span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->
*'''Delete''' for POV violation and being excessively broad with vague criteria. [[User:Wryspy|Wryspy]] 19:19, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Strong Delete'''. I nominated this. Once more, segregating women from the "list of significant ''figures'' in history" is misogynistic. The inference the reader might take from this list is that the figures included here would not be significant if they weren't also women. And is there honestly room for every single female celebrity ever? - Maggie --[[User:64.229.184.47|64.229.184.47]] 21:16, 22 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Do Not Delete'''. Neither the number of entries, not the size of the table of contents seems too long to me. I would suggest 2000 entries and 200 categories, respectively, as a criterion for "unmanageble". Then we could discuss some other method of acheiving the pedantic goal of finding counterexamples for stereotypes. Also, the number of "broad" puns in this poll seem at least sufficient already. Can we continue with "figures" for a while? --[[User:Davidrei|Davidrei]] 21:33, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''': Too broad. A pity though - it sure was a lot of work. --[[User:Gego|Gego]] 08:42, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
