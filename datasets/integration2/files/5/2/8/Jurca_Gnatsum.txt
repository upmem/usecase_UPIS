The '''Jurca Gnatsum''' is a [[France|French]] [[Homebuilt aircraft|homebuilt]] near scale replica aircraft based on the [[North American P-51 Mustang]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Popular Science|date=June 1970|title=All these planes you can build from plans|page=99}}</ref>

==Design & Development==
The Gnatsum (Mustang spelled backwards) is one of many wooden homebuilt designs from Romanian designer [[Marcel Jurca]]. Jurca, a [[Henschel Hs 129]] pilot in World War II, expanded his warbird replica designs to include the Allied [[North American P-51 Mustang]] fighter.<ref>{{Cite journal|magazine=Plane & Pilot|title=Marcel's Mini Fighters|author=Nick Stasinos|date=February 1972}}</ref>

The Gnatsum is a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with an enclosed single-seat cockpit and manually retractable tailwheel landing gear based on that of the [[Jurca Sirocco]].<ref>{{cite journal|magazine=Sport Aviation|date=Aug 1965|pp=35}}</ref> Suitable for a number of engines around {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, plans for the Gnatsum are available as the 2/3 scale MJ-7 and the 3/4 scale MJ-77, as well as the MJ-70 full-size representation. All versions are constructed from wood with fabric covering, and manufacturing rights to the kit aircraft were acquired by [[Falconar Avia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|magazine=Air Trails|date=Summer 1971|page=59}}</ref> Plans for the MJ-77 are available from Avions Marcel Jurca.<ref name="AMJ">{{cite web |title=Ordering Jurca Plans |url=http://www.marcel-jurca.com/index.php/en-us/drawings |website=Avions Marcel Jurca |accessdate=22 October 2019}}</ref>

Some of the engines suitable for the MJ-7 Gnatsum series are:-
*{{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Ranger 6-440]]C-5 inline engine
*{{convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Menasco C4]]
*{{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[de Havilland Gipsy Major]] I
*{{convert|125|to|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[AMC 6 engine#195.6|Rambler aluminum block in-line 6]]
*[[Buick V8 engine#215|General Motors aluminum V-8]]
