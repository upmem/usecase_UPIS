29 second sample of the song "[[Janie's Got a Gun]]" by [[Aerosmith]] from the album ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]''

==Fair use rationale==
This is a sound sample from a commercial recording. Its inclusion here is claimed as fair use because:

* It illustrates an educational article that specifically discusses the song from which this sample was taken 
* It is a sample of about 23 seconds from a much longer recording, and could not be used as a substitute for the original commercial recording; and 
* It is not replaceable with an uncopyrighted or freely copyrighted sample of comparable educational value. 
* It is believed that this sample will not affect the value of the original work or limit the copyright holder's rights or ability to distribute the original recording.
