'''Carl Immanuel Krebs''' (11 February 1889, [[Aarhus]] – 15 May 1971, [[Slagelse]]) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] doctor, humanitarian aid worker and explorer. He was the third child of First Lieutenant (later Major General) Frederik Christian Krebs (1855–1930) and Johanne Margrethe Busch (1858–1911),<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Slægten af Navnet Krebs|last=Krebs|first=Henrik|publisher=FH August Bangs Forlag|year=1935|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=44 ,118}}</ref> the brother of ceramicist [[Nathalie Krebs]] and the grandson of [[Dr. Frederik Christian Krebs]] (1814–1881) a physician, writer on political and social reforms, and editor of the [[Berlingske|Berlingske Tidende]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Krebs Portræt af en Forfatterskab|last=Jorgensen|first=Mette Lund|publisher=Forlaget Rhodos|year=2016|isbn=978 -87-7999-015-9|location=|pages=40}}</ref>   Carl Krebs graduated from the [[Metropolitanskolen|Metropolitanskole]] in 1907, and completed his medical studies in 1913. He was then resident in the surgical department of St. Joseph’s Hospital.<ref name=":0" /> As a student he competed in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] as part of the Danish team that won the bronze medal in the men's free system team gymnastics event. In 1914 he joined the Danish Army, not as a medical officer but as a recruit, and was promoted to Second Lieutenant in The [[Royal Life Guards (Denmark)|Royal Life Guards]] a year later.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Holger|date=2 April 1984|title=Carl Immanuel Krebs 1889-1971: Laege, Garderløjtnant, Ekspeditionesleder, Forfatter|url=|journal=Ugeskrift for Læger|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

Carl Krebs worked for the Danish Red Cross and the Danish Foreign Ministry in Russia from 1916 to 1920 monitoring conditions in Russian POW camps.  While there, he participated in an expedition to Central Asia (Mongolia and [[Tannu Uriankhai]]),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krebs|first=Carl|date=1921|title=Fra Mongoliet og Urjan-Chai|url=|journal=Geografisk Tidsskrift|volume=26|pages=|via=}}</ref> and in February 1918 was sent on a secret aid mission to [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)]] in Crimea, mother of the last Russian monarch, [[Emperor Nicholas II]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kejserinde Dagmars fangenskab pa Krim|last=Ulstrup|first=Preben|publisher=Gyldendal|year=2005|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=}}</ref>  In 1921 he was with the Danish Ambulance service in Poland during the [[Polish–Soviet War]]. In 1922 he returned to Russia as leader of the Danish Red Cross delegation in [[Fridtjof Nansen|Fridtjof Nansen's]] efforts to alleviate the [[Russian famine of 1921–22|Russian Famine of 1921-22]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=En Dansker I Mongoliet|last=Krebs|first=Carl|publisher=Berlingske Forlag|year=1937|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=88–96}}</ref>

In 1922 Carl Krebs organized and led an expedition to establish a farming, mining and fur trading settlement near [[Erdenebulgan, Khövsgöl|Erdenebulgan]] in the [[Khövsgöl Province|Khövsgöl]] province of northern Mongolia, however the enterprise never prospered.  The other members of the expedition, which included [[Henning Haslund-Christensen]], left by 1928 and Carl Krebs remained to raise horses as well as practice medicine. Subject to increasing harassment by the communist authorities in the 1930s, he was eventually forced to leave in 1937.  After his return to Denmark he published his memoir ''En Dansker i Mongoliet''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=En Dansker I Mongoliet|last=Krebs|first=Carl|publisher=Berlingske Forlag|year=1937|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=97–192}}</ref>

Carl Krebs worked as a war surgeon in World War, from 1939 to 1940 with the Danish Ambulance service in Finland and later from 1941 to 1943 with the Finnish Army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Danmark Sender en Ambulance|last=Lefevre|first=H|publisher=Gyldendal|year=1940|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=}}</ref> In 1940 he was employed by the (then neutral) United States at their Berlin Embassy to monitor conditions of Allied Prisoners held in German camps. In 1945 he served as Denmark's representative for the Red Cross, in the evacuation of Danish and Norwegian prisoners in Germany with "de hvide busser", or "the [[White Buses]]", a transport organization that brought Danish and Norwegian concentration camp prisoners from Germany to Sweden during the last months of World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Saadan kom de hjem|last=Kjerulf - Jensen|first=K|publisher=Munksgaard|year=1945|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=}}</ref>

From 1950 to 1951 he led the second part of the 3rd Danish Central Asian Expedition, which included travelling through the [[Rupshu]] region of the Indian Himalayas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rejsen til Den Blå Sø|last=Berthelsen|first=Asger|publisher=Gads Forlag|year=1998|isbn=|location=Copenhagen|pages=}}</ref> From 1952-1959 he served as a medical officer at the Danish naval base at [[Kangilinnguit]] (formerly Grønnedal) Greenland.  During his stay on the island of [[New Britain]] from 1960–61, he gathered material for ''New Britain: A Geomorphological Study in the Continental Drift'' (1961), which supported [[Alfred Wegener]]'s then-controversial theory of [[continental drift]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=New Britain: A Geomorphological Study in Continental Drift|last=Krebs|first=Carl|publisher=Venstreblads Bogtrykkeri|year=1961|isbn=|location=Skive|pages=}}</ref> His final expedition to the [[Sula Islands]] of Indonesia was cut short for financial reasons.<ref name=":1" />  He died in 1971.
