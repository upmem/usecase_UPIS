'''''Grand traité d’instrumentation et d’orchestration modernes''''', abbreviated in [[English language|English]] as the '''''Treatise on Instrumentation''''' (sometimes '''''Treatise on Orchestration''''') is a technical study of [[Western culture|Western]] [[musical instrument]]s written by [[Hector Berlioz]]. It was first published in 1844 after being serialised in many parts prior to this date and had a chapter added by Berlioz on [[conducting]] in 1855.

In 1904, [[Richard Strauss]] was asked to update the text to include some modern instruments and added musical examples from Wagner, and in 1905 the updated ''Treatise'' with a new preface by Strauss was published in German.<ref>''Instrumentationslehre'', Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss, CF Peters, Edition Peters 3120, Leipzig 1905</ref> The 1905 edition was translated into English in 1948.<ref name="its" />

The book discusses the various technical aspects of instruments, such as chromatic [[Range (music)|range]], [[Timbre|tone quality]], and limitations. An explanation of the role of particular instruments within the [[orchestra]] is also provided. The book also provides orchestral excerpts from [[classical music|classical]] [[Sheet music|scores]] to give examples of techniques discussed. These examples are sometimes of works by Berlioz himself, while [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] are also frequently cited.<ref name="its" />

Many composers studied the work closely, such as [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Strauss|R. Strauss]], and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]].
