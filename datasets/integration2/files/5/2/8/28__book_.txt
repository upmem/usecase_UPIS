'''''28: Stories of AIDS in Africa''''' is a 2007 non-fiction book by Canadian author [[Stephanie Nolen]], Africa correspondent for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.

The book profiles 28 Africans who have [[HIV/AIDS]], or have otherwise been affected by it. The number 28 was chosen to reflect the 28 million Africans who had HIV in 2007, according to [[UNAIDS]].  Nolen spent six years traveling through Africa to gather the stories.  The stories range from orphans, a truck driver, a miner, and a grandmother raising her grandchildren alone in poverty, to college educated patients, military members, clergy, and even [[Nelson Mandela]], whose son [[Makgatho Mandela|Makgatho]] died of AIDS.

[[Stephen Lewis]] described the book as "the best book ever written about AIDS, certainly the best I've ever read".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615025258/http://stephenlewisfoundation.org/grassroots/grassroots_canada.htm Stephen Lewis Foundation We're Reading] (Archived from [http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/grassroots/grassroots_canada.htm the original] on April 15, 2008)</ref>
