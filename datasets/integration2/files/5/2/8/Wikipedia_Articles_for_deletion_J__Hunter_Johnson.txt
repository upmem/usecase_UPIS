===[[J. Hunter Johnson]]===
This article has been prod'ed, de-prodded, speedied, de-speedied, discussed on the talk page, etc. It's not clear to me whether its subject meets [[WP:BIO]], so let us discuss it. ([[User:Paolo Liberatore|Liberatore]], [[User talk:Paolo Liberatore|2006]]). 15:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''weak delete''' as there's certainly a number of books and other works published by the author, but I'm not sure if there is enough for notability.  [[User:FrozenPurpleCube|FrozenPurpleCube]] 16:26, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''comment''' as the author (in violation of [[WP:AUTO]], explained on the Talk page), I won't vote, but the nominator for deletion appears to have done so in retaliation for my nomination of [[Steve O'Keefe (attorney)]] for speedy delete. Number of works doesn't appear to be a criterion, just "who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". Some reviews:

*:Some of the books have reviews on Amazon as well, but I'm not sure if they "count", so I'll leave them out. -- [[User:JHunterJ|JHunterJ]] 17:10, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
::Oh, so you made Gtoons?  Could you tell them to fix it? :)  Still, it's a bit troublesome to have you as the subject and author of the article, though I don't think you are doing anything specifically improper, and I understand your desire to not be confused with other people named Hunter Johnson.  So if anybody else wants to chime in to keep it, I'll go with them.  [[User:FrozenPurpleCube|FrozenPurpleCube]] 17:47, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:::If any of the other J. Hunter Johnsons (there's a lawyer in Texas, and a newspaper editor from 1904) gets a page, then I'm in trouble.  (I have gotten them to fix several things, but obviously not everything.) -- [[User:JHunterJ|JHunterJ]] 17:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
::(edit conflict) '''Clarification''': I have nothing to do with [[Steve O'Keefe (attorney)]]; I presume the above comment is about the anon editor who tagged the article with speedy, prod, and then afd (but could not complete the nomination for the obvious reason that anons cannot create new pages). ([[User:Paolo Liberatore|Liberatore]], [[User talk:Paolo Liberatore|2006]]). 17:48, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:::Right, sorry -- I'm familiar enough with the sequence that I didn't recognize the ambiguity... -- [[User:JHunterJ|JHunterJ]] 17:56, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep''', author of various notable game supplements. [[User:Kappa|Kappa]] 06:33, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep-Cleanup by [[WP:RPG]]''' The man is a published author, (in an albeit specialized genre of Role-Playing Games.) [[WP:BLP]] suggests caution here, specifically [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons#Dealing with edits by the subject of the article|Dealing with edits by the subject of the article]], especially the part where it says. "The [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee|Arbitration Committee]] has ruled in favor of showing mercy to the subjects of biographies, especially when those subjects become Wikipedia editors" I suggest we flag this for attention by [[WP:RPG]] and have them clean this article up to conform to WP standards. At the very least, userfy instead of delete.<small>—The preceding [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned]] comment was added by [[User:Roninbk|Roninbk]] ([[User talk:Roninbk|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Roninbk|contribs]]) 09:55, 19 September 2006.</small>
*'''Keep''', author with several widely-available published works.  Noteworthy within the genre. [[User:Shimeru|Shimeru]] 18:30, 20 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete:'''  Anybody can get published.  His edits blow.  I agree with the guy who said this article is about a hypocrite.  Anybody who patrols wiki like [[User:JHunterJ|JHunter]] does needs to be watched.  [[User:65.4.111.33|65.4.111.33]] 05:08, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Keep.''' Page was created as a disambiguation of other people with similar names ([[Hunter Johnson]], etc.). [[User:Jokestress|Jokestress]] 08:20, 23 September 2006 (UTC)
