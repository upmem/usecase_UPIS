'''''Congorhynchus''''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for "Congo snout") is a genus of prehistoric [[Actinopterygii|ray-finned fish]] that was described by E. Darteville and E. Casier in 1949.

Fossils belonging to ''Congorhynchus'' date back to the [[Maastrichtian]] stage of the [[Late Cretaceous]] as well as the [[Eocene]]. This means that this genus survived the [[Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event]] that killed the [[dinosaur]]s. There are three known species, all of which are extinct.
