==Critical reaction==
In 2014, Andrew Earles called the album "quintessential", and wrote that on it, Tiger Trap "packed each song with at least one pop hook."<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ufUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA333 |title=Gimme Indie Rock: 500 Essential American Underground Rock Albums 1981-1996 |last=Earles |first=Andrew |publisher=[[Voyageur Press]] |year=2014 |page=333}}</ref> In 2015, [[The A.V. Club]]'s Jason Heller wrote that the album "embodies twee," but added that "itâ€™s also a forceful, potent, consummately melodic complement to the more strident sounds of riot grrrl that were raging around them at the time."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/where-start-indie-charm-beat-happening-and-k-recor-226751 |title=Where to start with the indie charm of Beat Happening and K Records |last=Heller |first=Jason |website=[[The A.V.
