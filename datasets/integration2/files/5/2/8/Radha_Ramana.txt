==Famous Temple==
{{main|Radha Raman Temple}}
The quaint historic temple of Radha Raman has recently celebrated its 500th anniversary. It
has a steady flow of local worshippers as well as pilgrims from around the world. It is notable for housing the image that is the oldest remaining in [[Vrindavan]] for the longest continuous period, as Radha Raman remained in [[Vrindavan]] during the iconoclastic raids by [[Mughal emperor|Mughal King]] of India [[Aurangzeb]] during the seventeenth century, when other images were removed to be hidden in safer places outside the city.<ref name="Hawley"/> Performances of classical Indian devotional music are offered in Radha Raman temple nightly.

==History==
[[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] came to [[Ranga Kshetra]] in 1511 and stayed at Venkata's home. Venkata Bhatta had two brothers, Tirumalla Bhatta and [[Prabodhananda Sarasvati]]. They all belonged to the [[Ramanuja sampradaya]] and Prabodhananda Sarasvati was a ''tridandi'' ''[[sannyasi]]'' of that order. Vyenkata Bhatta had a son named Gopal, who was then just a child.

[[Gopala Bhatta]] was a son of a priest of [[Srirangam]].<ref name="Hawley"/> Venkata and his two brothers, Gopala's uncles Trimalla and [[Prabodhananda Sarasvati]] "were converted from their [[Sri Vaishnava]] faith in [[Lakshmi]]-[[Narayana]] as supreme to one in [[Radha]] [[Krishna]]" as Svayam bhagavan.<ref name = Brzezinski1992>{{cite journal

}}"identify Radha as the supreme Laksmi.."</ref> The dialog of this conversion is recorded in 16 c. Chaitanya Charitamrita biography by [[Krishnadasa Kaviraja]].

In the second volume of the ''Chaitanya charitamrita'' a presentation is given,<ref>[http://vedabase.net/cc/madhya/9/113/en Madhya 9.113-114]: "Just to associate with Kṛṣṇa, [http://vedabase.net/l/laksmi Lakṣmī] abandoned all transcendental happiness in [http://vedabase.net/v/vaikuntha Vaikuṇṭha] and for a long time accepted vows and regulative principles and performed unlimited austerities."</ref>  with a reference to the particular verse of the tenth canto of [[Bhagavata Purana]] as to the reason why [[Lakshmi]] also known as [[Sri]] (thus the name of ''Sri Sampradaya'') is burning with desire and still not capable of entering to the realm of [[Vrindavana]].<ref>[http://vedabase.net/sb/10/16/36/en SB 10.16.36]</ref>

[[Prabodhananda Sarasvati]], previously a [[Sri Sampradaya]] [[sannyasi]], was converted to supreme position of [[Radha-Krishna]] being [[Svayam bhagavan]] instead of [[Lakshmi-Narayana]]. He as well apparently came to appreciate the supremacy of Radha worship from Chaitanya.<ref name = Brzezinski19922>{{cite journal

Being pleased with [[Gopala Bhatta]] Goswami's sincere service and devotion, [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] initiated him, and ordered him to move to [[Vrindavana]] after the death of his parents and perform [[bhajan]] and write. He instructed him to serve his mother and father and always engage in chanting Krishna's glories.

At the age of thirty Gopala Bhatta Gosvami came to Vrindavana.

After [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]'s disappearance Gopala Bhatta Gosvami felt intense separation from the Lord. To relieve his devotee, the Lord instructed Gopala Bhatta in a dream: "If you want my darshan (visit) then make a trip to Nepal".

In [[Nepal]], Gopala Bhatta bathed in the famous [[Kali-Gandaki River]]. Upon dipping his waterpot in the river, he was surprised to see several Shaligrama Silas enter his pot. He dropped the silas back into the river, but the silas re-entered his pot when he refilled it.

[[Gopala Bhatta Gosvami]] found twelve [[Shaligram]]a shilas. It is believed once a wealthy man came to Vrindavana and offered Gopala Bhatta a variety of clothing and ornaments for his Shaligrams in charity. However, Gopala Bhatta couldn't use these for his round-shaped Shaligrams, so he advised the donor to give the Deity decorations to someone else. It's believed that donor refused to take them back and Gopala Bhatta kept the cloths and ornaments with his Shaligramas.

On the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] (full moon) day of in the evening after offering  to his Shalagram shilas, Gopala Bhatta put them to rest, covering them with a wicker basket. Late in the night, Gopala Bhatta took a little rest and then, in the early morning went to take bath in the Yamuna river. Returning from his bath, he uncovered the Shaligramas in order to render the [[puja (Hinduism)|puja]] for them, and saw amongst them a Deity of Krishna playing a flute. There were now eleven Shaligramas and this Deity. The "Damodara shila" had manifested as the beautiful three-fold bending form of ''tri-bhangananda-krishna''. In this way Radha Raman emerged in a perfectly shaped deity form from a sacred fossilized shaligrama stone.<ref name="Hawley"/> Devotees consider this image to be alive and that he grants a chosen family the privilege of assisting him in his daily schedule.<ref name="Hawley"/> In this way "the Lord has granted his wish and the stone was turned into a deity [[murti]] of Sri Krishna".<ref name="isbn81-7017-280-2">{{cite book
