'''Rong Fu''' is a Chinese-American [[Climatology|climatologist]], [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], researcher, professor, and published author with more than 100 articles, books, and projects detailing changes that occur in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and how they affect climate, seasons, rainfall, and the like. Fu has been invited to present over 115 presentations and seminars, and has administered more than 32 projects that received over 11 million dollars in funding. The focus areas of Fu's research are [[convection]]; cloud and precipitation processes and their role in climate; atmospheric transport in the upper [[troposphere]] and lower [[stratosphere]]; the interaction between the [[atmosphere]] and [[ocean]] and terrestrial vegetation; satellite remote sensing applications and retrievals; the interaction between rainfall rates and the [[rainforest]] in regions of the [[Amazon rainforest]]; and drought prediction in states across the [[United States]], including [[California]] and [[Texas]]. She is currently a professor in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Department at [[UCLA]] and the associate director of UCLA's Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science and Engineering.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jifresse.ucla.edu/people/director|title=Director and Associate Directors|work=Joint Institute for Regional Earth System Science & Engineering|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=3 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203103237/https://jifresse.ucla.edu/people/director|archive-date=2016-12-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://jifresse.ucla.edu/people/associate-directors|access-date=22 July 2018|title=Associate Directors}}</ref> She is also an adjunct professor in the Jackson School of Geosciences at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://directory.utexas.edu/index.php?q=Rong+Fu&scope=all&submit=Search|title=Rong Fu|work=Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=3 July 2017}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2018}}
Rong Fu was born in [[China]]. At the time, women were encouraged to pursue an education and enter the workforce afterwards. Fu attended [[Peking University]] and graduated as a [[meteorology]] major. She continued her education at [[Columbia University]], where she worked as a graduate research assistant and obtained her Ph.D. in [[atmospheric sciences]]. After completing her degree at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] University, Fu came to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) as a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences.

==Career==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2018}}
Fu's career spans decades of work as a [[Climatology|climatologist]], [[Meteorology|meteorologist]], faculty and chair at multiple universities, and president of scientific organizations. After receiving degrees from [[Columbia University]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], Fu was welcomed to the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] at [[Princeton University]] as a visiting scientist. After her time in Princeton, Fu spent five years at the [[University of Arizona]] as an assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences. Moving on from the University of Arizona, Fu became an associate professor in the School of Earth Atmospheric Sciences at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. During her time at Georgia Tech, Fu served as a guest professor at [[Beijing Normal University]] from 2007 through 2011. Fu's time at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] was as a professor at the [[Jackson School of Geosciences]]. During this time, Fu was also the associate chair of the Department of Geological Sciences and the leader of the Climate Dynamics Discipline. Fu was also elected as the president of the Global Environmental Change Focus Group of the [[American Geophysical Union]], serving from January 2013 to December 2016. During her time in [[Austin, Texas]], Fu was on a team of  [[climatologists]] and [[meteorologist]]s who worked with a [[Texas]] state agency{{clarify|reason=Which agency? Provide a source.|date=July 2018}} to design a prediction system that would help predict seasons of drought.

Fu has been invited to attend and speak at over 115 presentations and seminars. She has been the keynote speaker and invited to give presentations at [[University of Antioquia|Universidad De Antioquia]], in [[Medellín|Medellin, Colombia]], [[Stanford University]], [[Princeton University]], UCLA, [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], [[University of Tennessee]], [[Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology]] in [[Nanjing|Nanjing, China]], [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], and many more.

Fu has administered over 32 projects with more than $11 million in funding and has been the principal investigator for more than $9 million of that funding.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Many of these projects focused on the effects of [[rain]]fall, [[climate variation]]s, and seasonality on environments and on predicting climatic trends. Fu's research overlaps with that of [[hydrologists]], [[Agriculture|agriculturists]], and [[Ecology|ecologists]].

Fu has been on the board of reviewers for 15 journals and publications, including ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', ''[[Journal of Hydrometeorology]]'', ''Earth's Future'', and''[[International Journal of Climatology]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} She has reviewed grant proposals for agencies including the [[National Science Foundation|National Science Foundation (NSF)]], [[NASA|National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA)]], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]], and the [[Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Her career has also included work teaching graduate and undergraduate courses in the [[geosciences]] and [[atmospheric sciences]] at universities including Georgia Tech, UT Austin, the University of Arizona, and UCLA.

Fu currently works at UCLA as a faculty member in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and is serving as a visiting chair professor at [[Tsinghua University]] in [[China]].

==Research==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2018}}
Fu's research has spanned topics including [[convection]], [[cloud]] and [[Precipitation|precipitation processes]] and their role in [[climate]]; atmospheric transport in the [[Troposphere|upper troposphere]] and [[Stratosphere|lower stratosphere]]; interactions between the [[atmosphere]], the [[ocean]], and the [[vegetation]] produced by the land; and [[Remote sensing|satellite remote sensing applications and retrievals]].
 
Fu's research in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and across [[South America]] has demonstrated the importance of maintenance of the [[rainforest]] in sustaining the rainfall rates of the Amazon. Fu hopes to expands these research efforts to other areas such as the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].
