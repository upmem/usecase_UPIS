=== Soviet Air Force Antonov An-12BP ===
The Antonov An-12 belonging to the Soviet Air Force that was involved in the accident (callsign 08525) was part of a formation of four aircraft demonstrating tactical flight maneuvers to the [[Minister of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defense]], [[Andrei Grechko]].  Two of the aircraft were transporting equipment; the other two, including the one involved in the crash, was carrying paratroopers of the [[7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division]].<ref name=":1" /> Five flight crew members and 91 paratroopers were aboard the aircraft, all of whom perished in the crash.  The cockpit crew consisted of the following pilots: Major Alexei Ryabtsev, Junior lieutenant Vladimir Priplov, and Captain Nikolai Mikhailovich Maslyuk.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://war.airdisaster.ru/database.php?id=162|title=Столкновение Ил-14М и Ан-12БП над Калужской областью (борт 08525 (позывной)), 23 июня 1969 года. // AirDisaster.ru - авиационные происшествия, инциденты и авиакатастрофы военной авиации в СССР и России - факты, история, статистика|website=war.airdisaster.ru|access-date=2017-04-13}}</ref>

== Crash details ==
At 13:25 the An-12 involved in the accident (callsign 08525) took off from [[Kėdainiai Air Base]], and was the last one in a formation of four to take off.  The four An-12s took off in 8-10 minute intervals and held altitudes between {{convert|3000|and|3600|m|abbr=on}}.

At 14:07 the Ilyushin Il-14 took off from Bykovo Airport and climbed to the assigned altitude of {{convert|2700|m|abbr=on}}.

At 14:40:55 the crew of Il-14 contacted [[air traffic control]] and requested permission to climb to {{convert|3300|m|abbr=on}} due to severe [[turbulence]] and [[cumulus cloud]]s.  Due to the An-12s at {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}, the controller instead offered to grant permission for the flight to descend to {{convert|2700|m|abbr=on}}, but the pilots of the Il-14 declined the offer because the turbulence may be worse at a lower altitude.

At 14:50:17 the An-12 passed over Yukhnov and was switched to another controller and confirmed that they were at an altitude of {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}.

At 14:52 the two aircraft collided over Yukhnov.  The An-12 was on a bearing of 106-121° with a speed of {{convert|500|-|529|kph|mph kn|abbr=on}}; the Il-14  was on a bearing of 235-245° with a speed of {{convert|324|-|360|kph|mph kn|abbr=on}}h.  The aircraft first struck at the wingtips; then the An-12's nose collided with the right [[Tailplane|horizontal stabilizer]] of the Il-14. The An-12 lost the right wing and right wing engines from the impact, causing the aircraft to [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]] to the ground. The Il-14 lost part of the right wing and the upper part of the [[fuselage]].  The An-12 crashed in a field near Vypolzovo village, and the Il-14 crashed near Trinity village.  The aircraft fell approximately {{convert|3800|m|abbr=on}} apart from each other.  All 120 people aboard both aircraft perished.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" />

== Causes ==
The investigation into the crash found that the pilots of the Ilyushin Il-14 disobeyed instructions from air traffic control and climbed to the altitude of {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}} to avoid the clouds and turbulence, where the formation of Antonov An-12s were flying.  The collision occurred at an altitude of {{convert|2910|-|2960|m|abbr=on}}, the Il-14 should have been flying at an altitude of {{convert|2700|m|abbr=on}}.  The pilots of the An-12 were also found to be at fault for flying slightly lower than their assigned altitude of {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":3" />

== Memorial ==
[[File:Yukhnov mid-air collision 5.jpg|thumb|The memorial for the fallen soldiers.]]
[[Vasily Margelov]], Commander of the Airborne Forces and General of the Army, decided that a memorial would be constructed in memory of the fallen soldiers.  Money was raised for the construction of a monument to the dead soldiers.  In total, 250 thousand rubles were collected.  A year after the disaster, the memorial was constructed at the site the An-12 crashed.  The monument, designed by [[Yevgeny Vuchetich]], depicts a kneeling mother and paratrooper and contains the inscription: ''Eternal memory to the heroes-paratroopers and pilots''.  Next to the monument is a platform with 96 marble slabs, each with naming a soldier killed in the accident.<ref>{{Citation|last=avm74BC|title=Русский: Памятник на месте катастрофы самолёта Ан-12 после столкновения с Ил-14 ()|date=2012-07-28|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yukhnov_mid-air_collision_5.jpg|accessdate=2017-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=avm74BC|title=Русский: Памятник на месте катастрофы самолёта Ан-12 после столкновения с Ил-14 ()|date=2012-07-28|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yukhnov_mid-air_collision_7.jpg|accessdate=2017-04-13}}</ref>

At the site of the crashed Ilyushin Il-14 there is a monument to the pilots and passengers.
