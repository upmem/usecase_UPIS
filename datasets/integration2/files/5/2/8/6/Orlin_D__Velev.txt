'''Orlin D. Velev''' ({{lang-bg|Орлин Д. Велев}}) (born November 3, 1963 in [[Plovdiv|Plovdiv, Bulgaria]]) is the [[Invista|INVISTA]] Professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at [[North Carolina State University]]. He is best known for his work in [[soft matter]], [[colloid]] science, and [[Nanotechnology|nanoscience]].

== Biography ==
Orlin D. Velev was born in [[Plovdiv]], [[Bulgaria]]. Velev received his B.S. and M.Sc. in [[Chemical physics|Chemical Physics]] and [[Theoretical chemistry|Theoretical Chemistry]] in 1989 from [[Sofia University]]. He continued his doctoral studies at Sofia University to earn his Ph.D. in [[Physical chemistry|Physical Chemistry]] in 1996, while also spending one year as a researcher at the Nagayama Protein Array project in Japan. Following a postdoctoral position (1996-1998) and research assistant professorship (1998-2001) at the [[University of Delaware]], Velev joined the faculty in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at [[North Carolina State University]] in 2001, where he currently resides. He is married to Anka Veleva and they have one son, Orlin Velev Jr., who works in the aerospace industry.

== Professional contributions ==

=== Research interests ===
Velev's research covers a broad range of topics, but his key contributions are in the area of colloidal assembly. His research has advanced the field of directed and programmed colloidal assembly by using [[electric field]]s to make structures out of [[nanoparticle]]s, [[microspheres]], [[Janus particles|Janus]] and [[patchy particles]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bharti|first=Bhuvnesh|last2=Rutkowski|first2=David|last3=Han|first3=Koohee|last4=Kumar|first4=Aakash Umesh|last5=Hall|first5=Carol K.|author5-link=Carol K.
