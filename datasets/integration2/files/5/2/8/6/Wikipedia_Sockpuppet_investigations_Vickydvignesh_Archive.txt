All three of these accounts have been engaging in the exact same editing pattern on ''[[One Piece]]'' related articles, including removing a source that directly states the worldwide print copies of the manga series that came directly from the publisher[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/daily-briefs/2017-04-02/one-piece-manga-has-350-million-copies-in-print-worldwide/.114254] and adding in their own figure based on a compilations of sources. The similarity in name between Vickyluffy and Amvicky makes it obvious that the two accounts are the same person. —'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:TheFarix|t]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/TheFarix|c]]) 15:26, 13 April 2017 (UTC)

[[WP:QUACK]], quack. Same types of edits, same arguments that a reliable source is "wrong". —'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:TheFarix|t]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/TheFarix|c]]) 15:44, 18 April 2017 (UTC)
:added {{u|JOYDBOY}} as this is another brand new account making similar edits as previous socks. —'''[[User:TheFarix|Farix]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:TheFarix|t]]&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/TheFarix|c]]) 15:47, 18 April 2017 (UTC)

* Lots of intersections with one of the socks, [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/editorinteract.py?users=Amvicky&users=RajaRajaCholan&users=&startdate=&enddate=&ns=&server=enwiki Amvicky] in weird areas, like anime, manga, and Indian Tamil-language cinema.  
* {{noping|Amvicky}} was a chronic misuser of the minor edit feature, as is {{noping|RajaRajaCholan}}
* "Correcting Error" (with those caps) comes up a lot in RajaRajaCholan's and Amvicky's edit summaries. [[User:Cyphoidbomb|Cyphoidbomb]] ([[User talk:Cyphoidbomb|talk]]) 10:54, 17 September 2017 (UTC)

*{{Endorse}} - Seems pretty close for a duck call imo but not rock-solid, enough evidence for CU persists.  <span style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS',Geneva,sans-serif">[[User:QEDK|<span style="color:#f55">QEDK</span>]] ([[User talk:QEDK|<span style="color:#fac">愛</span>]] • [[Special:Contributions/QEDK|<span style="color:#fac">海</span>]])</span> 15:33, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
:*{{re|QEDK}} I don't see anything to check against, everything in the archives is stale. [[User:Courcelles|Courcelles]] ([[User talk:Courcelles|talk]]) 04:35, 18 September 2017 (UTC)
::*{{re|Courcelles}} Definitely my bad, I must have imagined some green "not stales" the last time I went through the archives, probably need my sleep.
