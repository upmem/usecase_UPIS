== Fair use rationale ==

This is being linked at the Michonne article on the English Wikipedia, and although it is subject to American copyright laws, I believe that it is covered by fair use laws because:
*It is of web resolution, i.e. it is of a lower quality than the original copy
*It clearly identifies the subject in question
*It is accompanied by commentary on the episode and character
*It features a significant character
*AMC, Robert Kirkman or Image Comics does not lose any rights to sell and advertise the show
