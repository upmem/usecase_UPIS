'''Karin (Duncan) Howard''' is a lawyer and politician. She represented [[Mooney's Bay Ward]] (now [[River Ward]]) on [[Ottawa City Council]], covering the south central area of the City.

== Early life ==
Howard, born in [[Toronto]], attended [[Malvern Collegiate]]. While completing her undergraduate degree in [[Biology]] at the [[University of Guelph]], Howard was elected to the Biological Students Council and the [[University Senate]]. She moved to [[Ottawa]] in 1981 with her husband, where they raised three children in the [[Riverside Park, Ottawa|Riverside Park]] area. Howard articled at Burke-Robertson, Chadwick & Ritchie, worked as a tax lawyer with Drache, Rotenberg, in government on the GST (Financial Institutions), and operated the business Tax Research Consultants.

== First mandate ==
In the [[1994 Ottawa municipal election|Ottawa municipal election of 1994]], Howard ran as a community representative to replace the departing [[George Brown (Ottawa politician)|George Brown]], defeating six opponents. On Council she was known as "Captain Accountability" for bringing in monthly performance reports<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hunt-club.ncf.ca/minutes/min9612.html |title=HCCO Minutes 2 Dec 1996 |website=Hunt-club.ncf.ca |date=December 2, 1996 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> to Council, a Code of Ethics, and the independence of the City Auditor function. She instituted monthly reporting to community associations and made it her practice to attend all meetings. Howard was part of the Fiscal Five on Council, routinely holding the line on spending. She also fought to protect greenspace<ref>{{cite web|author=CCAPresident |url=http://www.carlingtoncommunity.org/1997/05/cca-report-may-97/ |title=Carlington Community Association » CCA Report May 97 |website=Carlingtoncommunity.org |date=April 5, 2017 |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> by serving on the Environmental Advisory Committee, protecting McCarthy Woods, the Southern Corridor of the [[Greenbelt (Ottawa)|Greenbelt]], and saving the environmentally sensitive land at 4160 Riverside Drive. This land, situated at the end of the Ottawa International Airport main runway, was protected by a land swap, and kept future building heights from interfering with air traffic. Her successful motion to pay into reserve funds any extra money received by the City after the Budget, saved $1,000,000.

== Second mandate ==
Howard was re-elected in 1997, increasing her percentage of the vote from 35% to 62%, despite the strong challenge by respected school board trustee Kathy Ablett. During the municipal amalgamation discussions, Howard and Rideau Township Councillor Rob Fraser, jointly organized a televised public town hall discussion on amalgamation, and issued a report on the results. Howard brought a successful motion to support amalgamation on condition that the total budget of the new city would not be greater than the sum of the budgets of the amalgamated cities.

Howard announced in September 1998 that she would join her family in Beijing, China where her husband was newly posted with the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), now Global Affairs Canada. Instead, to ensure a balanced budget was passed, Howard stayed on Council for five extra months after her family had left. She resigned once the budget passed without a tax increase on a 6:5 vote split.

== Committees of Council and related boards ==

* Policy, Priorities and Budget
* Audit
* Planning and Economic Development
* Ottawa Public Library Board
* Riverside Hospital Board
* Central Canada Exhibition Board
* Police Services Board
* Environmental Advisory Committee
* Disability Advisory Committee.

In Beijing, Howard was elected to the local board of the Canada China Business Council for three years, and became chair of the Policy Committee. She was appointed as a trustee to the International School of Beijing and helped to build the new school at Shunyi, a USD74&nbsp;million project. As policy chair, Howard revised the school policies manual. She also served business clients at the law firm Goodman, Philips, and Vineberg in their Beijing Office.

Upon returning to Ottawa in 2001, Howard organized a rally to support a free press after Russell Mills, publisher, was ostensibly fired for allowing a certain editorial to be printed in the Ottawa Citizen.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mCNXFPLsCkC&q=%22karin+howard%22+-neverending++-cls+-tigress+-amazon++-therapist+-mourning+-linkedin+-pathologist+-classes+-etsy+-obituary&pg=PA102|title=Converging Media, Diverging Politics: A Political Economy of News Media in the United States and Canada|first1=David|last1=Skinner|first2=James Robert|last2=Compton|first3=Mike|last3=Gasher|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739113066|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marcedge.com/Asper_Nation_3W.pdf |title=AsperNation |website=Marcedge.com |accessdate=April 17, 2017}}</ref> For three years she managed an import business in Wellington West.
