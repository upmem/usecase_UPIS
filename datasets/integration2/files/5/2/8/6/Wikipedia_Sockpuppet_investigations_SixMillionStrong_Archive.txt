Supernaturalsamantha account was created shortly after most recent unblock request was denied.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Saltysausage&oldid=775479590] As before,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=/r/The_Donald&diff=775151199&oldid=775148712] editor insists on using a specific reddit post as a source.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=/r/The_Donald&diff=prev&oldid=775500198] 

As before,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SixMillionStrong&diff=prev&oldid=775198905] editor has difficulty with talk pages,[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:/r/The_Donald&diff=prev&oldid=775607554] (which could just be reddit's easier UI) and has an interest in recent negative news about Islam [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Khan_Shaykhun_chemical_attack&diff=prev&oldid=775489784] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2017_Melbourne_car_attack&diff=prev&oldid=775068949] (which could just be coming from /r/The_Donald). Sock acknowledges that /r/The_Donald might "at best" be Islamophobic.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=/r/The_Donald&diff=775112531&oldid=775070208]
