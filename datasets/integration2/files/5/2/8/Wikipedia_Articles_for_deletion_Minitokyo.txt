No evidence of passing [[WP:WEB]], not so many sites links to this one [http://www.google.com/search?q=link:http://www.minitokyo.net]. ([[User:Paolo Liberatore|Liberatore]], [[User talk:Paolo Liberatore|2006]]). 15:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*<strike>'''Weak keep'''</strike> '''Comment''' - [http://info.alexa.com/data/details?url=www.minitokyo.net Alexa rank of 9,805], and one of the main "anime wallpapers" websites - the difficult bit is proving it (and I'm not sure if that's enough to keep the article anyway. -- [[User:Makomk|makomk]] 16:46, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

*'''Comment''' This one is hard to say. 218K members would certainly make it pretty notable, but there ought to be sources about the site, I think. The page as it stands seems somewhat self-serving. [[User:Melodia|♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫]] 21:51, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
:*'''Comment''' To me [[WP:V]] is more important than membership numbers.  [[User:ColourBurst|ColourBurst]] 22:54, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete'''. [[WP:V]] is a big problem for an article that otherwise would have been kept. --[[User:Nishkid64|<span style="color:red">'''Nish'''</span><span style="color:blue">'''kid'''</span><span style="color:green">'''64'''</span>]] 23:17, 18 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I'm a member of the site, but yeah, I haven't seen much coverage of it in outside sources. So sadly, this article has got to go.

*'''Delete''' Alexa rank doesn't matter for keeping or deleting.  Any number range for making decisions based on alexa rank is purely arbitrary.  The test is at [[WP:WEB]] i.e. non-trivial media coverage, non-trivial award, or non-trivial media repritn of content.   It is nice wall paper, and if [[Museum of Modern Art]] decided to do an showcase them at an exhibit next month, it would pass with flying colors...  However, that's not the case and the article provides no evidence that it passes our [[WP:WEB|web notability guidelines]].   --[[User:Kunzite|Kunzite]] 00:27, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' I seem to remember expression an opinion to delete this before, too. Had it not been nominated previously? I guess I'm thinking of something else. Regardless, it still fails [[WP:WEB]]. [[User:GassyGuy|GassyGuy]] 08:12, 19 September 2006 (UTC)
