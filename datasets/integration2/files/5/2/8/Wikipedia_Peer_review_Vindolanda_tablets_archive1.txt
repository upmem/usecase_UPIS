This is one of the [[Our Top Ten Treasures|top-ten artefacts]] at the British Museum and considering the significance in British Roman history seems a good candidate for further improvement and revitalizing considering it is still relatively short but was originally created 4 years ago. Peer review comments with suggestions for what ought to be expanded (or corrected) and how the sources could improve would be useful in creating a to-do list and/or listing at [[WP:GLAM/BM]] for collaboration.

*The lead paragraph might say more about the initial find with references to published accounts of that find in academic journals --[[User:Profdrew101|Profdrew101]] ([[User talk:Profdrew101|talk]]) 17:55, 11 February 2011 (UTC)
:{{y}} I have added a couple of citations and the first year of discovery for the lead (choosing alternatives to Bowman as he is already well used). [[User:Fæ|Fæ]] ([[User talk:Fæ|talk]]) 10:07, 12 February 2011 (UTC)

Note, as the nominator for PR, I'm migrating this to GAN as I would like to write to an expert on the tablets for some feedback and collate any of their (probably emailed comments) as part of that process next week. [[User:Fæ|Fæ]] ([[User talk:Fæ|talk]]) 12:54, 12 February 2011 (UTC)
