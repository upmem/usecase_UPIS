'''Fay Zwicky''' (4 July 1933 – 2 July 2017) was an [[Australian]] [[poet]], [[short story]] writer, [[critic]] and [[academic]] primarily known for her autobiographical poem ''Kaddish'', which deals with her identity as a [[Jewish]] writer.

==Life==
Born '''Julia Fay Rosefield''', Zwicky grew up in suburban [[Melbourne]]. Her family was fourth generation Australian—her father, a doctor; her mother, a musician. Zwicky was an accomplished pianist by the age of six, and performed with her violinist and cellist sisters while still at school. After completing her schooling at [[Anglican]] institutions, she entered the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1950, receiving her [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1954. Descended from European Jews, she described herself as an "outsider" ("I was ashamed of my foreign interloper status") from an "[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] dominated" Australian culture. She began publishing poetry as an [[undergraduate]], thereafter working as a musician, extensively touring Europe, America and South-East Asia between 1955-65.<ref name="newsstore"/>

She settled in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] with her Swiss husband Karl Zwicky (the two married in 1957) and two children (one son, one daughter) and returned to literature working primarily as a [[Senior Lecturer]] in American and [[comparative literature]] at the [[University of Western Australia]] until her retirement in 1987. From 1978-81 she was also a member of the Literature Board of the [[Australia Council]] in [[Sydney]]. After her retirement she concentrated on her writing, which won her international recognition.<ref name="newsstore">[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=Fay+Zwicky&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=10&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=AGE070505KC7017ETEBJ ''The Age'' (5 May 2007)], Newsstore.fairfax.com.au; accessed 2 August 2017.</ref>

In 1990, Zwicky married her second husband James Mackie, who predeceased her. She led a reclusive life in Perth: "I never expect anything. I always think I'm drifting and nobody knows I'm here, and it's great."<ref name="The Age 11.2005">[http://www.theage.com.au/news/books/writers-solitary-life-interrupted-by-award/2005/11/11/1131578237917.html Solitary life interrupted by award], Theage.com.au, 12 November 2005.</ref> In 2004, Fay Zwicky was declared a [[Western Australia]]n "[[Living Treasure]]", a term she called "repulsive ... like being prematurely obituarized."<ref name="The Age 11.2005"/>

==Work==
Recurrent themes of Zwicky's were the relation between art and the artist, the exploration of the author's Jewish heritage and autobiographical experiences. Her poetry collections won several awards. The committee for the [[Patrick White Award]] praised Zwicky as "one of Australia's most original and accomplished poets".<ref name="The Age 11.2005"/> The ''Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' describes her style as "densely textured but elegant and direct".<ref>Dominic Head (ed.): ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'', 3rd edition. (Cambridge: University Press, 2006), p. 1240, {{ISBN|978-0521831796}}</ref>

Zwicky's first collection, ''Isaac Babel's Fiddle'' (1975) included a number of poems about her Lithuanian grandfather and his cultural displacement in Australia, which nevertheless saved him from the [[Holocaust]] ("Summer Pogrom", "Totem and Taboo"). Zwicky also writes of her own alienation, in spite of her being "whiter than [[Persil]]".<ref name=waking>Zwicky, Fay. [http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poets/zwicky-fay/waking-0174035 "Waking" (poem)], ''Poems 1970–1992'', Australian Poetry Library,  {{ISBN|0-7022-2466-9}}</ref>

The title poem of her most-admired collection, ''Kaddish'' (1982), is an [[elegy]] for her father who died at sea. In her poem Zwicky uses the [[Aramaic]] phrases of the traditional prayer of mourning to frame her own memorial prayer detailing her complex relationship with her father. She draws on the [[Haggadah]], the [[Passover Seder]] night liturgy. Kaddish" also uses the [[Lord’s Prayer]] and invokes God in female form as a goddess. [[Ivor Indyk]] describes ''Kaddish'' as "a mosaic of textual citations, of the Kaddish, the Passover Haggadah and numerous allusions to myth and nursery rhyme."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=13653|title=''The Poetry Archive''|publisher=Poetryarchive.org|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>

''Ask Me'', Zwicky's third book of poetry, contained poems on China, America, and a series of religious poems on the deities of the [[Hindu]] [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] ("Ganesh", "Vishnu", "Siva", and the goddess "Devi"). In Zwicky's subsequent books she developed a sparser style of poetry. In the title poem of ''The Gatekeeper’s Wife'' Zwicky wrote of the devastating loss of her husband, and recalls the custom of lighting a memorial candle. In "Losing Track" the death of her husband is linked with the tragic Jewish loss of [[Zion]]. The collection included an elegy, "Banksia Blechifolia", for [[Primo Levi]], and "Groundswell for Ginsberg", an homage to [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref name="newsstore"/>

Her latest collection of poems, ''Picnic'', published in 2006, gathered primarily poems about the nature of poetry and the poet's role in the world. Aside from her poetry, Zwicky published a collection of short stories, ''Hostages'', in 1983, and a collection of essays on literature and survival, ''The Lyre in the Pawnshop'', in 1986. In her essays Zwicky traced the ways in which the construction of an Australian literature has served to marginalize minority writers and women. She discussed the absence, until very latterly, of any place for a Jewish writer in Australian literature: "Living and growing up in this country has been an exercise in repression".<ref name="newsstore"/>

==Death==
Zwicky died in [[Perth, Western Australia]] on 2 July 2017, aged 83, two days before her 84th birthday.<ref name="aus_obit">{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Paige|title=Acclaimed poet Fay Zwicky dies in Perth at 83|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/books/acclaimed-poet-fay-zwicky-dies-in-perth-at-83/news-story/8f7d4163119bed65a40bc1d3eebeba0d|accessdate=13 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Australian]]|date=4 July 2017}}</ref>
