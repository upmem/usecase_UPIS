;Questions for the candidate
Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as an administrator. You may wish to answer the following <u>optional</u> questions to provide guidance for participants:
:'''1.''' What admin work, if any, do you intend to take part in?
::'''A:''' Clearing any backlogs, including but not limited to [[WP:CSD]]s and other items in [[:Category:Administrative backlog]]. I can also extend my assistance to [[WP:RM|Requested moves]].

:'''2.''' What are your best contributions to Wikipedia, and why?
::'''A:''' Road articles, particularly those related to New York. The reason I place these in high regard is, one, it is the state I live in, and two, it was a long, drawn-out process to bring each article up to standards, a process that is still ongoing today.

::One article that I take pride in, and also one that I helped start, is [[U.S. Route 9 in New York]]. After I laid the groundwork for the article, other users came in and added to the quality of the article, making it one of the best road-related articles produced in New York.

:'''3.''' Have you been in any conflicts over editing in the past or have other users caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future?
::'''A:''' There have been some scattered conflicts, most due to a small misunderstanding and usually resolved fairly quickly. One major conflict was [[WP:SRNC]], which was a large naming conventions poll involving some 100 editors and designed to end move warring that was taking place in numerous states. However, this conflict was resolved by the community at-large.

::In the future, I plan on dealing with conflicts in much the same way; that is, in a cool, level-headed manner, with discussion rather than pure reversion.

;A question from [[User:Thebainer|bainer]]&nbsp;([[User_talk:Thebainer|talk]])
:'''4.''' Under what circumstances should one [[WP:IAR|ignore a rule]]?
::'''A:''' One should ignore a rule if the rule prevents others from improving the project (that is, Wikipedia). Take [[WP:SRNC]] as an example. Pure [[WP:CON|consensus]] was never really achieved, as evidenced by the close final margin in part one of the poll. However, to improve the wiki and to put an end to the numerous move wars that had been occurring up to that point, it was decided to bypass consensus (ignoring the rule) and to treat the simple majority as consensus in an attempt to make progress.

::IAR should not be blindly applied. An example is that, let's say, a template that I believe is useful and improves Wikipedia is up for deletion. However, the vast majority of editors believe that the template is not useful. Would I invoke IAR and close the TFD as keep, just because I believe that the template contributes to Wikipedia? No, as consensus is clearly and overwhelmingly pointing to delete.

::To close, rules are made for a reason, and should only be ignored when there is a valid reason to do so. The example I gave above regarding SRNC is one (as it shifted focus from something trivial like the article name to improving the articles, which is where the focus should be). The hypothetical TFD example is not a valid reason to IAR.

::Feel free to ask me to elaborate on this issue, as I realize that the examples above may be a bit vague to some.

;Questions from [[User:Polaron|Polaron]] (feel free to ignore)
:'''5.''' In response to an anonymous user's persistent vandalism, what, in your opinion, is the most effective response: just keep reverting (no warnings), revert and leave warnings then block if he/she still continues, semiprotection of the page, or some other action? Why?
::'''A:''' Based on personal experience that I've had with anon vandals, the most effective response is to revert, go through the user warning ladder ("uw-test", switching to "uw-vandal" when appropriate), and then, when the vandalism reaches a blockable point, block the IP address. If the vandalism continues from another IP, I would then turn to [[WP:RFPP]] for a second opinion on the situation.

::The reason that I would go this way and in this order is that leaving warnings on the IP talk page to start with gives the anon the opportunity to cease vandalizing and to contribute productively to the encyclopedia. If the anon keeps vandalizing after the warning, then it would be clear to me that the anon is not here to improve the encyclopedia and that the blocking of the anon from editing would be beneficial to the wiki. As for RFPP, the reason that I would ask for a second opinion is that if I protected a page that I was continually reverting for vandalism, it would give the impression that I am supporting the pre-vandalized version. Yes, I know this example would be more applicable in content disputes, but my personal policy would remain the same nonetheless. Having the page protected by someone not involved with the article guarantees that there is no bias toward the version being protected.

:'''6.''' In AFDs or RMs, how much would you value comments that only say "Delete per nom" or "Move per nom" without giving additional reasons? If one side has a very strong argument but is overwhelmed by the number of "votes" on the other side mainly composed of such "per nom" votes, under what circumstances would you ignore counting "votes"?
::'''A:''' Not very, as unless the nominator outlined every potential reason for deleting the article, there is almost always something more that can be said. Simple "per nom" comments sometimes imply votestacking and, while often more than enough for TFDs dealing with deprecated templates, are not nearly sufficient for a discussion regarding the deletion or moving of an article, especially if the deletion/move is fairly controversial. So, to sum it up, I would definitely value elaborate comments with detailed rationale much more than simple "per nom" comments.
::I think the second part of that question got touched on in the end of the above paragraph (oops). I would consider ignoring counting votes if it is apparent that spamming or votestacking is occurring, such as heavy participation by anon editors, or if the "per nom" voters do not elaborate on their comments after they will be surely questioned to do so by the side who has the strong argument.
::I know that this second issue is often a touchy subject, and there is no conceivable way to give a single answer that would cover every possible situation. However, I can expand on my thoughts if requested.

:'''7.''' "Editors should remove any contentious material about living persons that is unsourced [or poorly sourced]... Editors who re-insert the material may be warned and blocked" (from [[WP:BLP]]). How rigorously would you enforce this?--[[User talk:Doc glasgow|Doc]]<sup>g</sup> 02:27, 29 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' If I see this occurring on an article, or if I hear that this is occurring on an article, I will fully enforce this policy and block editors who attempt to circumvent this policy. From the perspective of the person whose article is being vandalized, I certainly wouldn't want slander being placed on my article.

::As far as how I will enforce the policy, I will give warnings initially and block if it becomes clear that the user's sole purpose is to vandalize the aforementioned article.

'''Optional Questions from {{User|U.S.A.U.S.A.U.S.A.}}'''
:'''8.''' Is [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith]] an important guideline, especially for an administrator, and if so, how would you go about in applying this guideline?--[[Special:Contributions/U.S.A.U.S.A.U.S.A.|U.S.A.]] '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:U.S.A.U.S.A.U.S.A.&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new<small>cubed</small>]''' 05:34, 29 April 2007 (UTC)
::'''A:''' Assuming good faith is important, as trusting that editors are improving the encyclopedia with their additions is the only way that the wiki will improve. Personally, I believe good faith should always be assumed unless the editor has explicitly shown that their edits are not made in good faith. For an administrator, this is even more important for many reasons, including the rollback feature and the power to block editors. If AGF is not followed, then an editor with good intentions but poor writing form could have their potentially productive edits reverted and, if not enough patience is given, the editor could be blocked, creating ill will in the mind of the editor.

::I would apply this guideline as I described above; that is to AGF unless there is a clear reason not to. I will also attempt to give potentially productive editors the benefit of the doubt, preventing a situation like the one described in the last sentence of the above paragraph.

* Is there any reason why this spammed as a faux "you have messages" box on [[User talk:Vishwin60]]? Is it spammed anywhere else? --[[User:Kingboyk|kingboyk]] 19:19, 27 April 2007 (UTC)
**Honestly, I have no idea why it's being spammed there. I did not place that message there, nor did I ask the editor(s, in case it's in multiple places without my knowledge) to place it there. For the record, I do not endorse these messages nor am I campaigning for votes. I believe that this RFA should be an honest assessment of my ability, and the potential for votestacking that these messages create could cause this assessment to become a bit cheapened, something that I hope doesn't happen. --[[User:TwinsMetsFan|'''<font color="#CC0018">T</font><font color="#0000C0">M</font>F''']] <sup>[[User talk:TwinsMetsFan|Let's Go Mets]] - [[Special:Contributions/TwinsMetsFan|Stats]]</sup> 20:44, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

'''Discussion''' 

* [[Wikipedia:Consensus not numbers|Consensus not numbers]]: This is an intelligent and well thought-out nomination of a Wikipedian experienced in the often-contentious highways project.

#'''Support.'''  I agree with Vishwin that a more specific answer than "fix the backlogs" would be great.  But this editor is probably the most level-headed editor at the U.S. Roads WikiProject – rarely if ever fails to [[WP:COOL|keep cool]].  Any editor at USRD has experience at XFD, and he gives some of the better-reasoned arguments I've seen.  And even if not, XFD is probably the smallest of all the admin responsibilities.

A userbox saying "GAYS ARE DUMB" or something like that is divisive, yes. But a simple statement of sexual preference is not. Furthermore, I'd wager that many administrators have many more userboxes that are more divisive than those that I or TMF have. If you are against the use of userboxes, then please start a [[WP:VPP]] discussion; this is not the place to garner support against userboxes. --'''[[User:Rschen7754|Rschen7754]]''' ([[User_talk:Rschen7754|talk]] - [[Special:Contributions/Rschen7754|contribs]]) 05:31, 27 April 2007 (UTC)

#:<s>'''Opppose''' I have not seen strong evidence on [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith]] in others. But, depending on the answer of the question of AGF, I may think otherwise.

#'''Oppose''' Sorry I am not at all into the "Kelly Martin" thing but I am perturbed in this case that one of the two people that are listed as part of your project group (in your nomination) does not even support your candidature - considering that you should do more pre-admin time. I have run across a couple of your edits and have no personal complaints but something doesn't sit right when 50% of your fellows do not support you at this time.--[[User:VirtualSteve|<strong>VS</strong>]] <sup>[[User_talk:VirtualSteve|talk]]</sup> 08:53, 1 May 2007 (UTC)
#:That's a fault on the nominator in writing his nomination, not on the nominee.  Myself, MPD, Polaron, and JA10 (support votes #11, 16, 32, and 36) are all also active members in [[WP:IH]] and/or [[WP:USRD]] (the parent project), and it's certainly possible I've missed a few. -- [[User:Northenglish|'''NORTH''']] <sup>[[User talk:Northenglish|talk]]</sup> 18:45, 1 May 2007 (UTC)

'''Neutral'''
#'''Neutral''' Looks good, but think about doing more administrative work, and please be more specific than "fill the admin backlogs".  I haven't seen you doing much vandal work overall, and this troubles me (even though it isn't required, but strongly recommended).  Also the fact that you don't seem to participate in XFDs much, and this troubles me as well.  <s>To other users: please look at his contribs ''carefully'' before voicing.</s> '''[[User:Vishwin60|<font color="orange"><span style="background-color: #303030">V</span></font><font color="cyan"><span style="background-color: #6E6E6E">6</span></font><font color="white"><span style="background-color: #8D8D8D">0</span></font>]]''' <sup><font color="black">[[User talk:Vishwin60|干什么？]]</font> · <font color="blue">[[Special:Contributions/Vishwin60|VDemolitions]]</font> · [[Wikipedia:Editor review/Vishwin60 3|<font color="red">'''ER 3'''</font>]]</sup> 21:51, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

#:And I hate to see you changing your opinion for this reason. The notice of the RfA, which was not even placed by the candidate, is tasteful and neutrally worded.
