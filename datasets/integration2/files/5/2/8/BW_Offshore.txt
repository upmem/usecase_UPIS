==History==
{{more citations needed|date=June 2014}}
BW Offshore originates from the shipping company [[Bergesen d.y. ASA]]<ref>BW Offshore Annual Report 2013: http://hugin.info/136844/R/1772870/604070.pdf</ref> who delivered its first FSO Berge Sisar in 1982 which it installed and operated at the Block O field offshore [[Angola]]. In 2003 Bergesen was acquired by [[World-Wide Shipping]] and was 2005 renamed Bergesen Worldwide. In the same year the floating production part of the company was established as a separate company, Bergesen Worldwide Offshore.  In 2006 the company was rebranded BW Offshore and listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].

In 2007, BW Offshore acquired the ownership of [[Advanced Production and Loading]] (APL), making the company its technology division.<ref>APL: History website : http://www.apl.no/aplweb/templates/Level2Page.aspx?id=532 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707202653/http://www.apl.no/aplweb/templates/Level2Page.aspx?id=532|date=2007-07-07}}</ref> APL which is based in [[Arendal]], Norway and is a specialist in the engineering and supply of offloading and transfer systems for ships and terminals. It has delivered loading equipment for production vessels, storage vessels and shuttle tankers in the North Sea, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Russia, Latin-America, and the USA. In 2006, APL ventured into FPSO contracting by establishing [[Nexus Floating Production]] that consequently also became controlled by BW Offshore. In 2010, BW Offshore sold APL to [[National Oilwell Varco]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bwoffshore.com/Disclaimer/DIsclaimer0710121/Press-releases/Agreement-to-sell-APL-to-National-Oilwell-Varco-for-USD-500-million-in-cash/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020072917/http://www.bwoffshore.com/Disclaimer/DIsclaimer0710121/Press-releases/Agreement-to-sell-APL-to-National-Oilwell-Varco-for-USD-500-million-in-cash/ |archive-date=2013-10-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2010, BW Offshore Limited completed the acquisition of remaining 76.12% stake <ref name="BW01">[http://www.researchviews.com/energy/oil-gas/DealReport.aspx?sector=Oil_Gas&DealID=137021 BW Offshore Acquires Remaining 76.12% Stake Of Prosafe Production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426070455/http://www.researchviews.com/energy/oil-gas/DealReport.aspx?sector=Oil_Gas&DealID=137021 |date=2012-04-26 }}, researchviews.com</ref> in Prosafe Production Public Ltd.
