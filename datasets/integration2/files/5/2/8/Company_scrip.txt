==Lumber company scrip==
In 19th century United States forested areas, cash was often hard to come by.<ref name="David Ginsburg"/><ref name="Taylor 1951"/><ref name="Wis ref"/> This was particularly true in [[lumber]] camps, where workers were commonly paid in company-issued scrip rather than government issued currency.<ref name="Wis ref"/>

In [[Wisconsin]], for example, forest-products and lumber companies were specifically exempted from the state law requiring employers to pay workers' wages in cash.<ref name="Wis ref"/> Lumber and timber companies frequently paid their workers in scrip which was redeemable at the company store. Company-run stores served as a convenience for workers and their families, but also allowed the companies to recapture some of their labor expenses. In certain cases, employers included contract provisions requiring employees to patronize the company stores. Employees who wanted to change their scrip to cash generally had to do so at a discount.<ref name="Wis ref"/><ref name="Green"/>

Lumber company scrip was redeemable in lumber as well as other merchandise. According to the Wisconsin Historical Society, such an option may have appealed to new settlers in the region, who worked in the lumber camps in winter to earn enough money to establish a farm. Taking some of their wages in lumber may have helped them build a much-needed house or barn.<ref name="Wis ref"/>

'''Coal scrip''' is "tokens or paper with a monetary value issued to [[worker]]s as an advance on [[wage]]s by the coal company or its designated representative".<ref name="Edkins">{{cite book |title= Edkins Catalogue of United States Coal Company Scrip Volume 2 West Virginia|last= Edkins |first= Donald |authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher= The National Scrip Collectors Association |location= Huntington, West Virginia |asin=B0006E5ZQY |page= xxvii}}</ref> As such, coal scrip could only be used at the specific locality or [[coal town]] of the company named. Because coal scrip was used in the context of a coal town, where there are usually no other retail establishments in that  specific remote location, employees who used this could only redeem their value at that specific location.<ref>Edkins, p. xxviii</ref> As there were no other retail establishments, this constituted a [[monopoly]]. The coal town was established by out-of-state corporations and fueled by cheap labor provided by European immigrants who came to Appalachia in sight of work in the crowing coal industry.<ref name="wvgs.wvnet.edu">{{Cite web|title=WVGES Geology: History of West Virginia Coal Industry|url=http://www.wvgs.wvnet.edu/www/geology/geoldvco.htm#:~:text=Although%20coal%20was%20known%20to,place%20until%20the%20mid-1800s.&text=In%201810,%20the%20people%20of,coal%20from%20the%20Ohio%20banks|access-date=2020-10-03|website=www.wvgs.wvnet.edu}}</ref>

There was no uniform design, but each coin generally identified the location of the coal company town and predominantly featured the words "non-transferrable" to communicate to recipients it could not be transferred for U.S. currency.<ref name="Company Store Scrip"/>

From 1914 to 1924, during and following the [[First World War]], a variety of forms of German scrip were issued, including [[Notgeld]], Lagergeld, Gutscheine and Serienscheine. Such currencies were issued "by principalities, German colonial governments, cities, large corporations, small businesses, prisoner-of-war camps, and in some cases, individuals."<ref>{{cite web |title=German and European money and scrip used during and after the first World war, 1914-1924 |url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005686206/ |website=Library of Congress |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>
