'''Llanaber railway station''' serves the village of [[Llanaber]] near Barmouth in [[Gwynedd]], [[Wales]]. The station is an unstaffed halt on the [[Cambrian Line|Cambrian Coast Railway]] with passenger services to [[Harlech]], [[Porthmadog]], [[Pwllheli]], [[Barmouth]], [[Machynlleth]] and [[Shrewsbury]]. Most trains call only on request.

The station platform is located on a narrow ledge below the village of Llanaber and immediately above a rocky beach.

Since 22nd June 2020, trains have not called at the station due to the short platform and the inability to maintain social distancing between passengers and the guard when opening the train door.<ref>https://tfwrail.wales/covid-19/changes-train-times</ref>
