In Hydra, where he had been living since 1811, he married the sister of [[Georgios Kountouriotis|Georgios]] and [[Lazaros Kountouriotis]], Hydriote landlords and shipowners. He was also a significant shipowner before the [[Greek War of Independence|revolution]]. At the start of it, he gave all his ships to the revolutionary government. He became a delegate from Hydra at the [[First National Assembly at Epidaurus]] and a member of the twelve-member committee that modified the text of the first constitution. He had the position of the vice-president of the legislative corps from 13 January until April 1823. On 26 April and after Lazaros Kountouriotis denied the position, he was elected president of the legislative corps. A month later, on 22 May 1823, disappointed by the way politics had taken and anticipating the [[Greek civil wars of 1824–1825|upcoming civil war]], he resigned from his post. His political opponents had already accused him of factionalism due to the assistance he provided to Kountouriotis. In June 1823 he became a member of a committee jointly with [[Andreas Louriotis]] and [[Andreas Zaimis]] to negotiate about a loan in [[London]]. Before departing for the British capital, he wrote a letter about the need for unity and avoidance of civil wars. Also, on November 1823 he visited [[Lord Byron]] in [[Cephalonia]]. In January 1824, he and Louriotis, a man of [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos|Mavrokordatos]], was the Greek ambassadors who made the negotiations and finally borrowed the first British loan during the revolution, £800,000. In London, they were formally welcomed and they even met the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], [[George Canning]]. He was a member of the delegation who, in 1825, summed the second loan, £2,000,000. He returned to Greece on 1825 and continued representing Hydra at the National Assemblies.

== Life in independent Greece ==
Orlandos was a member of the [[English Party (Greece)|English Party]], considering the UK as the most effective country as of helping the revolution. He selected them due to the Kingdom's liberal political heritage and also its superiority in the sea. Then, he joined the anti-capodistrian faction stating that he preferred Greece a British protectorate instead of tolerating [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Ioannis Kapodistrias']] authoritarian administration. So he took part in the anti-capodistrian demonstrations of Hydra, during the summer of 1831. After all these and in searching for [[Scapegoating|scapegoats]] to apologize for the loans, he and Louriotis were accused of wrongful administration. They were firstly acquitted but, in 1835 the court characterised them responsible for the loss of £28,769. In 1839 they published their huge apology in two volumes which they later renounced. In 1837 he was one of the founding members of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]].
