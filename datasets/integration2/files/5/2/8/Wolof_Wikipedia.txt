The '''Wolof Wikipedia''' is the edition of [[Wikipedia]] in the [[Wolof language]]. It currently has {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|wo|N}} articles.

The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the [[Bambara Wikipedia]] and the [[Fula Wikipedia]]. [[Kasper Souren]], a Dutchman who worked with [[Geekcorps]], wrote in a report to an open source conference that until 2006 "not much happened" on the Wolof Wikipedia.<ref name=Lihp158>[[Andrew Lih|Lih, Andrew]]. ''[[The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia]]''. [[Hachette Books#Hyperion Books|Hyperion]], [[New York City]]. 2009. First Edition. {{ISBN|978-1-4013-0371-6}} (alkaline paper). p. 158.</ref> Up until that year, many small articles with very little content were posted.

In April 2007 Ibrahima Fall (username Ibou), a [[Senegal]]ese student living in [[Italy]], began adding substantial content to the Wolof Wikipedia.<ref name=Lihp158/> It had 500 articles in November 2007, 543 articles in June 2008, and 1028 articles in August 2015.<ref name=Lihp158/><ref name="wikimedia">{{cite web|url=https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias|title=List of Wikipedias|website=Meta|accessdate=2017-12-28}}</ref>
