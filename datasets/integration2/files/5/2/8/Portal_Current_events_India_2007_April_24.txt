<!-- NOTE: 

Before posting, please make sure you are familiar with posting guidelines:
* Please log news events in the present tense.
* Only list items with news sources; stories without links will be removed. 
* News stories must be in the English; no other languages please.
* For each item, please update the most relevant linked article if it is appropriate.
* Stories added to the main portal page should be of national and regional interest for India. 
* Do not list the ordinary deaths of prominent persons here. That's what [[Recent deaths]] is for. Exceptions to this rule are made for persons of extreme prominence, such as Jawaharlal Nehru, MS Subbulakshmi, or Mother Teresa.
* Please do not link to subscription-only sites such as AOL or WSJ (except in the unlikely event that a story is covered substantially better there than anywhere else).
* Please avoid Yahoo! news links, as those URLs are temporary and die quickly! (You can use a search engine to get the original source.)
