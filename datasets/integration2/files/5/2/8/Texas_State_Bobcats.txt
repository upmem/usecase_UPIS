The '''Texas State Bobcats''' are the sports teams that represent [[Texas State University]]. Currently, they compete in the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in [[NCAA Division I]] ([[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] for football). The Bobcat has been the mascot of Texas State University since 1921, when the university adopted the name from the recommendation of a committee formed to raise school spirit. Smaller than mountain lions, bobcats are known for their stubborn fierceness and great courage. The football squad used the bobcat for the first time in 1921 and went undefeated with a 7–0 season. Texas State had several officially recognized live bobcat mascots until the 1970s. In 1964, the Texas State Bobcat was given the official name of "Boko" by Beth Greenlees, a sophomore from Luling, Texas, who beat out about 100 other students in a "Name the Bobcat" contest. Her winning submission earned her a $5 prize and the honor of being the person who named the Texas State mascot. Boko has twice been named “USA National Champion” mascot. Texas State had no official fight song until 1961, when Paul Yoder was commissioned to compose "Go Bobcats." The song is the rousing "call to arms" for all Texas State athletic games and competition.

Texas State joined the Sun Belt Conference on July 1, 2013.<ref name="WAC membership">{{cite web|title=WAC to Add Denver, UTSA and Texas State |url=http://www.wacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10100&ATCLID=205028332|publisher=[[Western Athletic Conference]]|accessdate=2010-11-11}}</ref>

=== Nickname ===
{{Rquote|right|A bobcat will fight you with everything he has: with four claws, teeth, speed and brains.|Oscar Strahan, former athletic director and head football coach}}The bobcat is indigenous to Central Texas, where Texas State University is located. Oscar Strahan, a former athletic director and football coach for the school, was quoted as saying, "A bobcat will fight you with everything he has: with four claws, teeth, speed and brains." The colors, maroon and gold, come from the Gaillardia flower, which is native to the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.txstatebobcats.com/sports/2010/7/29/GEN_0729105908.aspx?id=64#almamater|title=Texas State Athletics Traditions – Links|publisher=Txstatebobcats.com|accessdate=2015-06-04}}</ref>

=== Rivalries ===
Texas State has Sun Belt rivalries with all of the West Division schools (Arkansas State, Little Rock, Louisiana-Lafayette, Louisiana-Monroe, and UT Arlington). Their main Sun Belt rival is [[UT Arlington Mavericks|UT Arlington]].

==== I-35 Orange vs. Maroon Rivalry ====
The I-35 Orange vs. Maroon Rivalry series is the name given to the athletic competitions between the Bobcats and the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] [[UTSA Roadrunners|Roadrunners]]. The name is derived from the Interstate highway that essentially links the two schools who are in relatively close proximity to each other. In the beginning of the rivalry, a trophy was awarded to the winner of the men's basketball game. It has grown, however, to include all common sports the two schools compete with each other in throughout the academic year. A point system is used to crown a winner after the last competition between the schools in that year. The trophy is then inscribed with the annual winners and the winning institution retains the trophy for one year until the next winner is crowned.

Texas State took the 2007–08 trophy before UTSA reclaimed it for 2008–09, but the Bobcats brought the hardware back to San Marcos at the end of the 2009–10 competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.txstatebobcats.com/promotions/maroon-orange.html |title=Orange-Maroon rivalry |publisher=Txstatebobcats.com |accessdate=August 1, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123953/http://www.txstatebobcats.com/promotions/maroon-orange.html |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}</ref>

==== The Battle for the Paddle ====
In fall 1998, just before the Bobcats were scheduled to take on the [[Nicholls State University|Nicholls State Colonels]], rains flooded San Marcos and the field at Bobcat Stadium.

Athletic directors and coaches from each school decided not to continue with the game and coined the annual contest named "Battle for the Paddle," joking that fans and athletes needed to use a boat and paddle to get to the game. The game eventually took place on November 28, 1998 with the Bobcats prevailing 28–27 to win the Paddle.

Texas State currently trails in the series with 13 wins against the Colonels' 16, as the Colonels re-took the paddle in 2010, eventually winning 47–45 in 4 OT.

2010 was Texas State's last year playing football in the Southland Conference. In 2011, they were FCS Independent and in their first year of transitioning to FBS. Since Texas State was playing with more scholarship players, Nicholls State opted not to bring the paddle to San Marcos for the final scheduled matchup between the schools.  The Texas State team created their own paddle and won the game, 38–12. The Colonels retain possession of the actual paddle trophy.

==== Bobcats vs Bearkats ====
The rivalry between the Sam Houston State Bearkats and Texas State Bobcats is no longer active due to Texas State's moving to the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] and Western Athletic Conference. The Bearkats and Bobcats have played each other 89 times, and is the most played FCS rivalry game in Texas as of 2011. Texas State currently leads the series 48-36-4.
