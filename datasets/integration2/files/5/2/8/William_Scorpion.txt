==Biography==

===1961–1982: Early life===
Scorpion was born in the residential [[Protected areas of Singapore|conservation area]] of [[Joo Chiat]], a district in the [[east Region, Singapore|eastern region]] of Singapore. He was born the eldest child into a family of four siblings, with him being the only son in a family of three younger sisters. He received his early education at Bukit Merah Primary School (now demolished) and his secondary education at [[Anderson Secondary School]], before being enlisted into the [[Singapore Armed Forces]], where he eventually vocationed as an [[Singapore Infantry Regiment|Infantry section leader]]. After his consignment, he ventured into part-time modelling.

===1983–1992: Career beginnings===
Scorpion's singing talent was only first discovered by a chance visit to a friend's club opening, called ''Gold Leaf Esteem Salon'' at Parklane Shopping Mall. When dared to sing on stage by his friends, he gamely took on the dare and sang a classic Cantopop ballad "上海滩" (''[[Shanghai|Sheung Hoi Tan]]''), the theme song from the popular Hong Kong period drama ''[[The Bund (TV series)|The Bund]]'', originally sung by [[Frances Yip]], in front of a live audience. His performance immediately impressed the club manager and he was offered a singing contract to perform at his club. Within 5 months, he had gained such a fan following and recognition from local music producers that he was offered a starring role in [[MediaCorp Channel 8|Channel 8's]] prime time (8:00 – 10:00 PM [UTC+08:00]) live [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] singing show, called ''Live at Studio One'', produced by ''Studio One''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ng Kheng Lau & Studio One|url=http://www.eguide.com.sg/Companies/Ng-Kheng-Lau-Studio-One|accessdate=9 December 2011|work=Catch|publisher=Reed Business}}</ref> It aired every weekday and he was a regular performer from 1983 to 1992.<ref name="bss">{{cite web|title=Scorpion, Thanakorn|url=http://www.busystock.com/executive/Thanakorn_Scorpion.html|accessdate=12 September 2011|work=BusyStock}}</ref> This wide exposure to the local Mandarin-speaking population helped secure his local fan base and increase his popularity.

In 1988, he embarked on a solo, three-night, sell-out, summer showcase concert in [[Guangzhou]], China to promote the "Singapore-style" of Canto and Mandopop.<ref name="bss"/>

===1993–2005: Continued rise to prominence===
