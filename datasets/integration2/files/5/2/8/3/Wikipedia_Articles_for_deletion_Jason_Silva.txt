Fails [[WP:BIO]]. I cannot find any means by which this person is notable. Not [[WP:ARTIST]] and not [[WP:PROF]]. Page appears mostly as a [[WP:SOAP|soapbox]] to me and I can't see how to fix it since the person simply doesn't seem notable.

* '''Keep'''. The references and links in the article show he was the focus of a feature article in ''The Atlantic'', was featured in a segment on CBS news, and does appear to be "originating a significant new concept, theory or technique" per [[WP:ARTIST]].

**If we had more sources like ''The Atlantic'' interview, I certainly would not be here. However, I can't help but think that this doesn't quite rise to the level of coverage we would want for a [[WP:BLP]].

* '''Keep''' There are multiple independent reliable sources in this article including The Atlantic, Forbes, Wired, CBS, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and here is one from the Washington Post [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/jason-silva-on-what-it-takes-to-be-a-wonder-junkie/2013/03/09/5a3376f0-88c6-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394_blog.html]. This guy is definitely notable [[WP:GNG]]. [[User:I am One of Many|I am One of Many]] ([[User talk:I am One of Many|talk]]) 18:16, 21 August 2014 (UTC)
