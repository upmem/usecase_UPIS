Luddington was educated at [[Uppingham School]], where he was coached by the famous cricketer [[H. H. Stephenson]], at [[The King's School, Ely]] and at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].<ref name="venn">{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/stream/p2alumnicantabri04univuoft#page/230/mode/2up | title = Alumni Cantabrigienses: Henry Luddington | author = J.

Picked for the 1876 [[University Match (cricket)|University Match]] against [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]], he took 5 for 51 in the first innings and 4 for 72 in the second as Cambridge won by seven wickets; in the first innings, he shared the Oxford wickets with [[William Patterson (cricketer, born 1854)|William Patterson]], with whom he had been at school at Uppingham.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2031.html | title = Scorecard: Oxford University v Cambridge University | date = 26 June 1876 | publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 16 August 2014}}</ref> Luddington's best bowling performance came for Cambridge in 1877 against the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]]: he took 5 for 28 as MCC, including [[W. G. Grace]], were dismissed for just 60.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2083.html | title = Scorecard: Cambridge University v Marylebone Cricket Club | date = 17 May 1877 | publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 16 August 2014}}</ref> In the 1877 University Match, Luddington and Patterson again shared the Oxford first-innings wickets equally, Luddington taking 5 for 90, but Oxford won the match easily.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/2/2111.html | title = Scorecard: Oxford University v Cambridge University | date = 25 June 1877 | publisher = www.cricketarchive.com | accessdate = 16 August 2014}}</ref> After leaving Cambridge, Luddington played only one further first-class match, appearing for the Gentlemen of England in a fixture at Cambridge in 1878.

Luddington appears not to have followed any career after graduating from Cambridge in 1877; he was a [[Justice of the Peace]] and a county councillor for the [[Isle of Ely]] after that district achieved county status with local government reform in 1888.<ref name="venn"/> He bought Walton's Park at Ashdon on the Essex/Cambridgeshire border in 1917 and died there five years later.<ref name="venn"/>
