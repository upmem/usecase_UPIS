Dr '''Meredith Leigh Mitchell''' an Australian [[agronomist]]. She is a Senior Research Scientist with the Victorian [[Department of Environment and Primary Industries (Victoria)|Department of Environment and Primary Industries]].

==Career==
Mitchell has worked for the Department of Environment and Primary Industries and been based at [[Rutherglen, Victoria|Rutherglen]] for the last 25 years. She is a [[pasture]] agronomist and her research has focused on the selection of native grass [[cultivar]]s for agricultural systems and the management of existing native pastures.

Mitchell has participated in a number of multi-disciplinary teams, collaborating with agricultural scientists from different state departments and universities throughout Australia. This research has involved national [[germplasm]] by environment trials on a range of both native (NLIGN)<ref>Garden DL, Waters CM, Smith AB, Norton MR, Auricht GC, Kobelt E.

Mitchell has published an identification book on native grasses,<ref>Mitchell M. Native Grasses: an identification handbook for Temperate Australia. 3rd edition ed. Collingwood, Vic.: CSIRO Publishing; 2002. {{ISBN|9780643066564}}</ref> which is currently in its third edition, and has co-authored two book chapters on native pastures.<ref>Bennett R, Mitchell M.

Mitchell received her PhD in 2013 from [[Charles Sturt University]]. The research focused on Microlaena (''[[Microlaena stipoides]] var. stipoides'') a native perennial grass that is widespread in native pastures of the temperate high rainfall zone (> 550&nbsp;mm AAR) of south-eastern Australia.<ref>Mitchell M.

A greater understanding of species ecology will allow better optimisation of its contribution to the provision of feed and [[ground cover]]. To undertake this postgraduate training, Mitchell was supported by a scholarship from Charles Sturt University, a top up scholarship from FFI CRC and a DPI postgraduate award. Mitchell also received a Fellowship from AW Howard Memorial Trust.

EverGraze – Chiltern Grazing Experiment. 2013 [26 May 2014]; Available from: http://www.evergraze.com.au/library-content/chiltern-grazing-experiment/.</ref>  EverGraze is seeking to develop new farming systems for the high rainfall zone (>550&nbsp;mm) based on deep rooted perennial pastures that significantly increase wool and livestock producers' profits, while stabilising or enhancing natural resource management (NRM) outcomes. This research has focused on the effects of grazing management on the production, botanical composition and nutritive characteristics of perennial native pastures using a breeding [[merino]] ewes.
