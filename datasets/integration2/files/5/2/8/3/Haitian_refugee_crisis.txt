== Background ==
{{See also|Haitian boat people}}
The first "boat people" landed in the US in 1972. This was in response to a brutal dictatorship by [[François Duvalier]] and [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]. As became the standard, Haitian refugees fleeing the [[dictatorship]] were met with "arrest, jail, the denial of [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]], and swift expulsion." The administration of US President [[Jimmy Carter]] was forced to take a different approach in 1980 because a large wave of Cuban refugees arrived and the US government could not treating the two groups with such different policies. Carter created a new [[immigration]] category called "entrants" for Haitians and Cubans "whose fate was to be decided at a later date by legislation" but who were allowed to be in the US.<ref name=":1" />

US President [[Ronald Reagan]] changed the policy in 1981 and sent the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] to intercept and [[Repatriation|repatriate]] Haitians fleeing by boat. He jailed the refugees who made it to the United States. Refugees continued to flee during the militant governments that followed the Duvaliers.<ref name=":1" /> [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]] was in power for eight months before being overthrown. During this time both [[Human rights|human rights abuses]] decreased <ref name=":9">{{Cite book|title=Refugees in America in the 1990s : a reference handbook|last=W.|first=Haines, David|date=January 1, 1996|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=9780313293443|oclc=468292394}}</ref> and the number of people trying to leave decreased by one third.<ref name=":1" /> Six weeks after Aristide was overthrown, at least 1,500 Haitians had been killed.<ref name=":9" />  The number of refugees fleeing by boat skyrocketed to new levels as did the people fleeing into the [[Dominican Republic]]. In the entire decade before Aristide was overthrown, 25,000 Haitians were intercepted at sea; 38,000 were intercepted in the first year after he was overthrown.<ref name=":1" />

The US had well established methods of intercepting, jailing, and repatriating Haitians by the time the largest wave of people seeking refuge arrived. These policies were pursued by multiple US presidents because of American anti-Haitian biases that saw Haitian immigrants as a threat based on a combination of [[racism]], [[nationalism]], [[xenophobia]], [[Class discrimination|classism]], and misperceptions that Haitians carried disease at higher numbers than other nationalities.<ref name=":2" />

== History ==
=== Presidency of George H. W. Bush ===
[[File:USS Moinester (FF-1097) with Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay 1991.jpg|thumb|USS Moinester (FF-1097) with Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay 1991]]
The number of Haitian refugees fleeing the country by boat escalated to new levels after Aristide was overthrown.<ref name=":1" /> The [[George H. W. Bush]] administration opted to continue the policy of repatriation that had been used for Haitian boat people previously when they were fleeing the Duvalier dictatorship. If the refugees made it to US soil, they would be protected from repatriation by [[international law]].<ref name=":3" /> The administration began redirecting the refugees to Guantanamo Bay after the Haitian Refugee Center won a court case that established a temporary restraining order against forced repatriation.<ref name=":0" /> By November 1991, the Administration had to raise the previous cap of 2,500 refugees at Guantanamo.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Refugee camp for Haitians at base rapidly filling up|last=|first=|date=November 28, 1991|work=The Hartford Courant|access-date=}}</ref> The camp continued to grow substantially until May 1992 when around 11,300 refugees were being held at the military base. The refugees were held on six subcamps in McCalla Airfield and [[Camp Bulkeley]]. There weren't enough supplies. Many refugees slept on cardboard or bare ground and others on cots. Each camp was surrounded in barb wire fencing. Refugees rotated through each camp as they passed or failed each exam on the way to asylum. However, refugees were not told the significance of the movement between subcamps.<ref name=":2" />

Bush announced that the US would begin slowly emptying the refugee camps and instead solely return the Haitians trying to escape persecution back to Haiti through Executive Order 12,807 called the Kennebunkport Order in May 1992.<ref name=":0" />  The order did not screen the Haitians for potential to seek asylum as earlier policies technically required.<ref name=":4" /> The administration expressed fears of the camp inspiring Haitians to try to leave and favored a harsher policy to discourage escaping by boat.<ref name=":8" />  As the claims of the refugees at Guantanamo were processed,  the refugees were slowly relocated, brought to the US, or often repatriated throughout the end of Bush's presidency.<ref name=":3" />  From its beginning until March 1992, 34,000 refugees had passed through the camp. Permission to pursue asylum in the US was given to roughly a third of them.<ref name=":9" />  A small group of refugees was kept at Guantanamo.<ref name=":3" /> The remaining refugees at Guantanamo were approved for filing for asylum but tested positive for [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] or had family of those who tested positive and therefore continued to be held at Guantanamo at a section of the base known as Camp Bukeley.<ref name=":2" />

=== Presidency of Bill Clinton ===
{{Further|1994 Cuban rafter crisis}}
[[Bill Clinton]] had campaigned against the forced repatriations during the 1991 US presidential race. He changed his mind shortly before taking office in 1993 and instead continued the Kennebunkport Order policy of forced repatriation. He wanted to stabilize Haiti and reinstall [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide|Aristide]] through force in part to discourage more people from fleeing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Clinton says U.S. will continue ban on Haitian Exodus|last=Sciolino|first=Elaine|date=January 15, 1993|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> Meanwhile, 270 refugees remained in Camp Bulkeley due to their connection to HIV.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|url=|title=HIV-infected Haitian Refugees Sent to U.S. From Guantanamo|last=|first=|date=April 6, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}</ref> They were brought to the US after a legal battle headed by the Haitian Centers Council.<ref name=":0" /> The HIV camp closed on July 18, 1993.<ref name=":4" />

Less than a year later, Guantanamo was again opened to hold refugees in June 1994.<ref name=":5" /> The new camp held first Haitians then Haitians and Cubans.<ref name=":6" /> Cubans only began to be sent to Guantanamo after Clinton reversed a nearly [[Cuban immigration to the United States|30-year-old policy of immediate amnesty for Cubans arriving to the US]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Detention camp in Cuba to hold 40,000 refugees|last=|first=|date=August 25, 1994|work=Edmonton Journal, Edmonton Alta.|access-date=}}</ref> However, the Cubans were treated noticeably better than the Haitians.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gtmoinnola.wordpress.com/portfolio/116/|title=Issues of Race: Cuban and Haitian Refugees at GTMO|last=Berg|first=Rebecca|date=January 2, 2015|work=GTMO in NOLA|access-date=April 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> In an effort to decrease the size of the camp, the US tried to convince other countries in the [[Caribbean]] or [[Latin America]] to accept either Haitian or Cuban refugees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Haven Search For Haitians Falling Short; Pressure Rises for US to Take Tougher Steps|last=Suro|first=Roberto|date=July 15, 1994|work=The Washington Post|access-date=}}</ref> Up to 21,000 Haitians were held in Guantanamo at one time during this wave of the Haitian refugee camp.<ref name=":11">{{Cite news|url=|title=Haitians forced to return|last=|first=|date=January 7, 1995|work=The Gazette, Montreal, Que.|access-date=}}</ref> More than 30,000 Cubans were detained at once at the camp.<ref name=":7" /> The main problem for the camp in sustaining so many people was primarily infrastructure such as water, electricity, and sewage, not space.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=US scambles to prepare for refugees|last=|first=|date=August 25, 1994|work=St. Petersburg Times|access-date=}}</ref> Roughly 10,000 Haitians agreed to return home after President Aristide was returned to power in October 1994.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Call for equal treatment of GTMO Haitian and Cuban Refugees|last=|first=|date=November 11, 1994|work=New York Beacon, New York, NY|access-date=}}</ref> However, 6,000 were forcibly repatriated against their wishes.<ref name=":12">{{Cite news|url=|title=Cubans in the US Push Asylum For Refugees Detained at Bases Series: US Marines stand guard at the base in Cuba near the place where dozens of Cuban refugees have escaped or tried to flee in recent weeks.

== Controversy ==
=== Camp Bulkeley HIV quarantine  ===
[[Camp Bulkeley]] began under US President [[George H. W. Bush]] in late 1991<ref name=":3" /> and ended under [[Bill Clinton]] 1993. Camp Bulkeley was used to hold 270 refugees approved for asylum who tested positive for [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] or were related to someone with HIV at the camp. The presence of [[HIV/AIDS]] meant they were not allowed to come to the US according to a 1987 law. Simultaneously, they could not be repatriated to Haiti due to international law protecting approved asylum seekers.<ref name=":2" />  The US said the camp was a [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] endeavor.<ref name=":0" />

[[Karma Chávez|Karma Chavez]] wrote, "These refugees lived in deplorable conditions, were subjected to violence and repression by the US military, deprived of proper medical care, and left without any legal recourse of rights."<ref name=":3" /> According to the research of A. Naomi Paik, the food was rotten and the camps were squalid and lacked proper infrastructure for sanitation. Boredom filled each day. Medical procedures happened without consent administration of including [[Depo-Provera|Depo Provera]], a long term birth control. "The refugees question[ed] whether the U.S. state intended for them to live longer or die sooner," wrote Paik.<ref name=":2" />

The treatment of these refugees is part of a larger discrimination against Haitians though a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Center for Disease Control]] enforced association with the disease and the nationality.<ref name=":9" /> The CDC identified the Haitian nationality as being an at-risk group of HIV. [[ACT UP]] was a major advocacy group for ending the detention of HIV+ Haitians in Guantanamo.<ref name=":3" />

On March 26, 1993, U.S. District Judge [[Sterling Johnson Jr.]] ruled that the "government either had to provide medical treatment for those with the AIDS virus or send them where they could be treated"<ref name=":10" /> for what he famously deemed a "HIV prison camp."<ref name=":0" /> The Clinton Administration that replied saying 36 refugees with HIV would be brought to the US. As the first part of the follow-through on Judge Johnson's ruling in early April 1993, 20 Haitians, 16 with HIV and 4 relatives came to the US. Those with low immune cell counts received the highest priority for leaving the detention camp.<ref name=":10" /> In early June 1993, Judge Johnson ordered that the remaining refugees be taken away from Guantanamo within ten days to two weeks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Haitians with HIV leave Cuba base for lives in US|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref> The camp finally closed on July 18, 1993.<ref name=":4" /> Half of the Haitian survivors of Camp Bulkeley had died by 2013.<ref name=":0" />

In January 2010 [[United States Air Force]] reservists were deployed to help victims of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]], and some of those reservists worked to prepare the Guantanamo base to receive more Haitian refugees.<ref name="Usaf2010-01-27">{{cite news

=== Differing treatment of Cubans and Haitians ===
{{See also|Wet feet, dry feet policy}}
[[File:Young Haitian refugee returning from Guantanamo to Haiti.jpg|thumb|Young Haitian refugee returning from Guantanamo to Haiti]]
Largely due to the politics of the [[Cold War]], the US supported the Haitian government under the [[Duvalier dynasty|Duvaliers]] and simultaneously did not support the Cuban government under [[Fidel Castro|Castro]]. Because of these international relations, the US encouraged Cuban refugees to come to the US but denied this option to Haitian refugees. The US called the Haitian refugees "[[economic migrant]]s" and was therefore able to reject asylum obligations.<ref name=":0" /> Also, there was racial discrimination separating the treatment of Haitians and Cubans as found in the US Court of Appeals, Second Circuit with Haitian Centers Council v. McNary in 1992.<ref name=":4" /> The treatment of the two groups was frequently compared.

The special treatment of Cuban refugees decreased when they were being held at Guantanamo.<ref name=":0" /> Nevertheless, considerable disparities continued. The Cubans had the advantage of having a [[Cuban Americans|strong political block]] already in the US that advocated for the Cubans in Guantanamo.<ref name=":12" /> For example, the US said it would encourage voluntary repatriation for Cubans; however, Haitians were forced to repatriate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Guantanamo will expand|last=Lipman|first=Larry|date=August 25, 1994|work=Pittsburgh Post|access-date=}}</ref> In another example, 200 Haitian unaccompanied children were left at Guantanamo long after the Cuban children of the same position were brought to the US. Very few of the Haitian unaccompanied minors were allowed to enter the US. By April 1995, only 23 of about 300 children had been accepted. All of the unaccompanied Cuban children were admitted to the US.<ref name=":7" /> HIV testing was not required for Cubans or other non-Haitian groups emigrating to the US but was mandatory for Haitians immigrating to the US.<ref name=":9" />  The differences between the two groups challenged the treatment both groups were receiving.
