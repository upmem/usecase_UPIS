== Notation for points in 4D space ==

When giving coordinates in [[four-dimensional space]], does the dimension perpendicular to meatspace, or to the only triad of dimensions renderable spatially, conventionally come ''before'' or ''after'' the dimensions x, y and z? For example, should the center of the default spawn region in ''[[Minecraft]]'' (which, in [[JSON]], is {'dimension':0; 'x':0; 'y':128; 'z':0;}) by expressed as (0,0,128,0) or (0,128,0,0) [when a ''w''-axis is reserved to distinguish the overworld from the Nether and the End]?

::And even so, I believe it's customary to put w fourth. -- [[User:Meni Rosenfeld|Meni Rosenfeld]] ([[User Talk:Meni Rosenfeld|talk]]) 05:47, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

: Incidentally, for the [[hyperboloid model]] of hyperbolic space, which uses one "redundant" timelike dimension, I've seen (and used) both conventions: ''t,x,y,z'' and ''x,y,z,t''. â€”[[User:Tamfang|Tamfang]] ([[User talk:Tamfang|talk]]) 07:30, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

:(x,y,z,w) is the canonical form I was taught for euclidean 4-space, but Minecraft is a different construct from that, isn't it? I mean, if we want to be precise, I'd think the overworld is a (subset) of R^3, and the netherworld is another copy of R^3. So, mathematically, I think this world would be [[isomorphic]] to the [[Disjoint_union_(topology)]] of X,Y, where each X,Y is a subset of R^3. --Except not quite, as we'd have to identify the points where the player can travel from the overworld to the netherworld. Anyway, ''representing'' this as 3+1 space where the +1 is just a flag for netherworld seems reasonable enough, but I thought the actual topology of the world might also be interesting to consider. (It doesn't work well anymore, but there was a time when discussing [[Asteroids_(video game)]] was a good way to illustrate the topology of the [[torus]] ;) [[User:SemanticMantis|SemanticMantis]] ([[User talk:SemanticMantis|talk]]) 17:09, 7 August 2014 (UTC)
::Further- if there were only one point to transport between the overworld and netherworld, the game space would be the [[Wedge_sum]] of two copies of R^3. I may be missing something, but I think that construction could be generalized to take a quotient by n-many pairwise point identifications. The point is, the game world is not really a 4-space, it's a [[quotient space]] of a disjoint union of 3-spaces.
