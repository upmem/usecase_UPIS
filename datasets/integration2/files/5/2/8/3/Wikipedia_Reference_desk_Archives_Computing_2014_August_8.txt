== Using school Wifi vs broadcasting own SSID? ==

I am on a US university's Wifi network where I have to enter my student ID and password in order to log onto the Wifi network. A friend is suggesting that the Wifi will be more secure if we use our own router, protected by WPA2 protection, plugged via Ethernet to the school's dorm internet network and broadcast our own SSID. Is the latter more secure?

[[User:Acceptable|Acceptable]] ([[User talk:Acceptable|talk]]) 03:32, 8 August 2014 (UTC)
:More secure against what? In theory, an access point YOU control plugged into the LAN port ''would'' be more secure than an AP someone else controls, but ultimately you are ending up on the same network which is only as secure as its weakest point. Using your own router to connect to the network isn't practically going to protect you in any meaningful way I can think of. Probably running a decent firewall and AV on your own computer would be more beneficial in either case. . [[User:Vespine|Vespine]] ([[User talk:Vespine|talk]]) 04:07, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

::Is it more secure against hackers potentially intercepting your traffic? For ex, if I upload stuff onto Google Drive or Dropbox, would having my own SSID broadcast point be more secure against potential interception? Like you know how they tell you never to log into your email on a public Wifi hotspot, such as Starbuck's or something? Does the same precaution apply when using a university's wifi network, where you have to enter a student ID and password to log on? I'm thinking the same precautions should not apply here because Starbucks is an unsecured wifi hotspot (you don't have to enter a password to log onto the wifi), whereas here, I have to enter a student ID and my password.

:::It ''may'' be more secure between your device and the point where it hits your campus's wired network.  It will not be any more secure from there onwards - someone could plug a computer into a network socket in a neighbouring room which is wired back to the same switch, and could possibly use a variety of tricks to make that switch broadcast your data on their port.

== [[Web colors]] ==

I don't know that topic very well and my knowledge is only based on some articles I have read. So (0, 255, 0) is a quite light green tone called lime. Why is the model still called RGB (red, green, blue) and not (red, lime, blue)? I know there is this clash between HTML and [[X11 color names]]. Can you explain the history of the use of these two sets? The article doesn't describe it in detail. This is pretty confusing and also affects Wikipedia articlies. The infobox in the article [[Green]] shows lime (0, 255, 0), not the darker variation (0, 128, 0), which most people perceive as the standard "green". In addition to this, the infobox in the article [[Lime (color)]] shows (191, 255, 0), probably because it refers to some other model. You have to scroll down to see the web color "lime". Same for [[Orange (colour)]], which shows (255, 127, 0). If you click on another Wikipedia in a different language, others values are shown. Finally I found out that the web color is (255, 165, 0). With the Simple English article [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange Orange], I also found out that (255, 127, 0) is the Color Wheel Orange, yet another model? Shouldn't we agree to one model on the English Wikipedia? --[[Special:Contributions/2.246.13.110|2.246.13.110]] ([[User talk:2.246.13.110|talk]]) 04:18, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

:See [[color theory]], [[color model]], [[color space]], [[color perception]]. Also search the ref desk archives for "color", this sort of thing comes up a lot. My perspective is that the ''physics'' of color is fairly straightforward, it's just about the [[spectrum]] of light, and how much energy is at each frequency. However, once we get into production of color and human perception, there are many different systems and words, because there are many different uses and goals. [[Color psychology]] has a section on culture, which explains a bit about how different people have different words for the 'same' colors, or how the same name is associated with different colors. I haven't read it, but this book also looks like a good reference for this sort of thing: [[Basic_Color_Terms:_Their_Universality_and_Evolution]]
:I personally don't agree that we need a standard model for en.wikipedia, each article can and should use whatever terms are most appropriate for the topic. E.g. it would be wrong in my opinion to treat  [[prussian blue]] as an RGB triplet. There is a good reason that the image there is a photograph of a paint smear, and not a computer-generated signal.

::My reading of [[bitmap]] is that it can be generally used as a term for a [[raster graphic]], compared to a [[vector graphic]], but of course also often means the specific .bmp format.

:::I'm making my own Half-Life Mod, and I'm hoping to use a model from a western mod where the player character carries scorpions as a weapon. However, the Western character uses a "bare flesh-colored hands" texture, whereas Gordon's black gloves were made by being textureless. Since I don't know how to delete the flesh texture, I was hoping to replace it with an invisible texture in the hopes that would solve the problem. Also, I read online that GIMP doesn't support transparent bitmap, only the workaround with pink squares, and I don't think Half life honors the pink squares as transparent. Can someone direct me to a tutorial explaining how to do this in GIMP? [[Special:Contributions/98.27.241.101|98.27.241.101]] ([[User talk:98.27.241.101|talk]]) 19:05, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

The basic idea is that you'll create a 128x128 black square, then set it to 100% transparency. If your mod system will accept it, you might get better results using [[.png]], rather than .bmp.

== Where do hackers start out? ==

I'm pretty sure nobody is born knowing about technology, so how do future 1337 h4xx0rz start learning about it? I mean a reasonably smart person who can use a computer well enough for the everyday things it is marketed to do, but knows nothing about it beyond that. How do you get from there to writing software, or cracking websites, or [[Mosquito laser|building a Star Wars laser system out of eBay bits to shoot down mosquitoes in your back garden]]?

:Many hackers and even many regular every day programmers are [[autodidact]]s.  They find something that interests them and they learn about it.  They find something that they want to do with their computer and learn what they need to do it.  I did this with my first web site back in the mid-90s.

::I would start earlier than that: ''learn math.''  Learn lots of math.  Get really good at math.  When you think you've learned "enough" math, ''study math for five or six more years.''
::Why!?
::Let's talk about real technology problems that we face in Year 2014.  Especially if you are interested in physics, electronics, or computing, ''you will never face a problem caused by moving parts.''  Every technology problem you encounter will have no moving parts; its root-cause will be invisible; and you will need to use ''your brain'' to fix it.  You will need to learn to think ''abstractly'' - but not in the way that artists or painters of drug-trips think.  You will need to think ''abstractly but subject to rigorous formal rules about structure and process.''  This is the way that mathematicians think.
::When you learn the earliest types of algebra - like the way our teachers taught us long division in 2nd or 3rd grade - you are learning more about computers than your five-year-old brain can even comprehend.  You are learning ''problem-solving-by-procedure.''  As you get older, and you study harder problems (like solving for roots of a parabola), you're reemphasizing that structured procedural thought-process.  Finally, you'll get to the point where you can really get ''creative'' - you'll know how to solve the roots of a parabola by the [[quadratic equation]] and by [[successive approximation]] - but ''what other ways'' can you find those answers?  ''Presto,'' you have just come up with ''a method to build a machine to do ____.''  
::For any sufficiently complex problem δ, you'll need sufficient quantitiy of creativity ε and a sufficient search-space of tool functions ζ{...} that spans (or intersects) the solution-space.  You will need a meta-method to efficiently inject δ onto the appropriate tool-function... and presto, your solution is discovered.  The actual construction of the machine naturally follows.  If your method is sound, and your problem is relevant, the physical construction of that machine is ''so incredibly easy'' that somebody will build it.  If you're ''the one'' who figured it out, and your solution method was actually in the critical path, rest assured that our economic system will find ways to reward you proportionally.
::I find it unfortunate that so many people get "wow"ed by shiny metal and flashing blinking lights and visions of giant monochromatic text consoles.  That sort of fiction has been portrayed by movies and internet clickbaiters, and it's put forward as "hackery."  That's exactly what it is!  Just like a screen writer who regurgitates tired storylines and silly tropes - we call him a ''hack'' - because his work is not very good, and its only selling point is that it ''looks almost like other work that actually has merit.''

:::"Every technology problem you encounter will have no moving parts" {{citation needed}}. I suppose you may personally have never had a flat bicycle tire, or a faulty doorknob, etc. But for most of us, moving parts still exist and still occasionally fail. Also, OP specifically talks about a [[robotics]] example, so at least some familiarity with how physical things can be fitted together is required for that.

:::::Two of the absolute best software developers I've ever known both had history degrees from the University of Chicago. So I guess that would be my recomendation. Just kidding, although the thing about the two developers is true and I say it to emphasize what others have said, there is no one correct path. Some things I would recommend to get started, some of these are fairly old but they are classics and IMO every software developer should still read them: The Mythical Man Month by Fred Brooks, No Silver Bullet also by Fred Brooks, Extreme Programming explained by Kent Beck, The Spiral Model by Barry Boehm. I would say Java is the best language to start with because it's state of the market and also a true programming langauge unlike some of the scripting languages. You can download the Eclipse Java IDE from IBM for free. It's also used a lot and a great environment to get familiar with. On a more theoretical level the book Elements of the Theory of Computation by Lewis and Papadimitrious is great. Probably best to take a class that covers those kinds of issues. It also depends if you want a career in Informatoin Technology (i.e., to progress to manager and above) or if (and nothing wrong with this) you just want to be a really outstanding developer. If you want to progress my recommendation is to keep in mind that while technology is cool it's the human issues: defining requirements, usability, i.e., not just building a technical solution but making sure that the solution you are building actually is the right thing for the business that is critical. Also, just as an editorial aside I have no use for people who are dogmatic about this or that technology and say things like "Microsoft sucks" or "PHP is an affront to humanity". The critical thing is matching the appropriate technology to the specific business probolem and business environment. Religious arguments about some technology being the answer to everything or the devil that can never be used are childish and pointless.   --[[User:MadScientistX11|MadScientistX11]] ([[User talk:MadScientistX11|talk]]) 17:56, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

:Going along with Nimur, I would say that you should start trying to solve problems that are interesting to you.  Don't worry if they've been solved before (they have, usually for better and cheaper).  The key is not just to learn the math, programming, etc., but to learn how to apply it to new situations that you encounter: ones that aren't in the textbook.  For example, I was interested in building a device to flip a coin so that it would land on the same side every time.  I remembered my basic physics equations for 2-D motion, so I used them to calculate how high the coin would travel for a given initial velocity.  I then thought about how to impart that velocity: I thought about using a spring, but since that would be difficult to calibrate, I used an air compressor instead.  Then, I had to relate the pressure applied by the compressor to the height of the coin clip, which led me to a much clearer understanding the definition of pressure as force per unit area.  I never did get it to work (largely because trying to impart the correct rotation was beyond my capability), but I learned a great deal, and I had a lot of fun trying!
