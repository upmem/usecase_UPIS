== Make article titles case-preserving, not case-sensitive ==

Currently, the title of a Wikipedia article is case-sensitive except for the first character.  This means allows articles like [[Gentleman's Agreement]] and [[gentleman's agreement]] to exist side by side.  (If there is more than one place where a letter after the first might be capitalized, there can be more than two similarly titled articles.)

I submit that:
* Instances where this is actually useful are quite rare.
* Most computer searches, including Google's, treat words and phrases case-insensitively, so that's what most people will find obvious.
* Library catalogs likewise access titles case-insensitively (indeed, the ones I'm familiar with don't even preserve the case of the original title).
* The idea that in Wikipedia the first character is treated differently is additional level of non-obviousness, but does not cause any major problems.

On the other hand:
* Disambiguation of similar article titles by suffixes like "(film)" or "(aviation)" or "(politician)" is common on Wikipedia and easily understood, and could easily be applied to cases like the example by renaming to "Gentleman's Agreement (film)" or "gentleman's agreement (concept)".
* Indeed, in a number of cases the lower-case article is a disambiguation page that might as well have been named using the standard suffix "(disambiguation)".
* In cases where such similarly titled articles exist, there is generally a hatnote pointing from each to the other.  If the reader who opened [[gentleman's agreement]] wanted [[Gentleman's Agreement]], their experience by following the hatnote will be no different if it points to "Gentleman's Agreement (film)".

I therefore propose that article titles should become [[case-preserving]] but no longer case-sensitive.  Obviously this transition can't be done in a single step, but I propose the following sequence of steps to achieve it (note: I've edited this from my original posting, where I did not quite get it right).

#By "canonical name" I mean the lower-case form of an article title. Change the software that interprets URLs and implements the search blank so that if there is no hit on an article name as given, then the canonical name is tried.
#By "special redirect" I mean a redirect from the canonical name of an article to its actual name, e.g. from "william lyon mackenzie king" to [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]. Change the article-creation software so that (1) when an article is created or retitled, if its title is not already in canonical form and there is no existing article with the canonical form of the title, then a corresponding special redirect is also automatically created; and (2) no further articles with the same canonical name as an existing article can be created, except for special redirects.  Simultaneously change the editing software so that if an article is already a special redirect, it cannot be edited.
#Using a one-time bot, find all cases where the article title contains a capital letter and the canonical name is not already used for an article, and create a special redirect.  If there are multiple articles whose canonical name would be the same, but no existing article whose name is the canonical one, the bot should create only one special redirect, making an arbitrary but sensible choice as to which one it redirects to: perhaps to the largest of the existing articles, or the one with the longest version history, or the one with the fewest capital letters in the title.
#Start a project where people would identify articles whose titles differ only in case, and retitle at least one of each such pair (or group), adding or cleaning up hatnotes as necessary.  Redirects to other capitalizations of the same name, except for special redirects, can be deleted during this process.  Once the process is complete as well as the above technical changes, the desired effect has been achieved.
#When this is complete, the final optional step is to clean up the article database to eliminate the special redirects. To do this, the database would be changed to make the canonical name the primary key for accessing each article, with the actual (case-preserving) title stored as an additional data item.

In writing all this, I primarily have English in mind, but of course the same would apply to titles in other languages that have the concept of case&mdash;and I guess to Wikipedias in all languages.

That's all I have to say.  I don't plan to get involved in any way with the project I'm proposing, and if the Powers That Be think the whole idea is a non-starter, that's their prerogative.  But I think it's a clear win, and I think the sequence I've set out should avoid situations where "you can't do that".  Given that case-sensitive titling has always been kind of unexpected, I was actually a bit surprised that I didn't find it on the "perennial proposals" page; but I didn't, so I'm proposing it now.

* '''Support!''' In principle, I think this is a fantastic idea. Imagine all the redirect-cruft from variant capitalizations that could be swept away forever!
: &#8942;
: I do have a quibble or two with the proposed implementation. For example: for the same reason that the "eBay" article is technically at "EBay", the "canonical" version of an article title should be the "display" title rendered entirely in lowercase, ''except'' for the first character, which, if a letter, should be in uppercase. This would not only accommodate the existing technical requirements of the MediaWiki software, but would also have the additional benefit that the vast majority of articles' "canonical" and "display" titles would be identical, in which case no "special redirect" would be necessary. Also, it would be worth considering that if a URL containing the name of an article incorrectly capitalized were followed, then MediaWiki would respond with an [[HTTP redirect]], using either status code [[HTTP 301|301 (Moved permanently)]] or [[HTTP 303|303 (See other)]], to the URL with the article name capitalized correctly (i.e., matching the article's "display" title)—rather than accepting the misspelled URL and presenting the article page with a "(redirected from …… )" hatnote.
: &#8942;
: One hurdle to overcome will be the fact that usernames are case-sensitive, and it would not be feasible to make the "User:" and "User talk:" namespaces case-insensitive—at least, not to the left of the first "/" character. I also anticipate some grumbling about the special role of ALL-CAPS titles as shortcuts to things in namespaces such as "Help:" and "Wikipedia:". I'm not sure how much of a "collision" problem there would be if these namespaces were rendered case-insensitive, but my guess is that the number of [[WP:SHORTCUTS]] that share a spelling with a non-shortcut page to which they don't redirect (or both don't redirect to the same target) is very, very small.
: &#8942;
: In sum, while the implementation would be non-trivial from a technical standpoint, much of it could be automated, and my intuitive impression is that this change would be warmly welcomed by our readers and editors. —&nbsp;'''[[User:Jaydiem|Jaydiem]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:Jaydiem|talk]]) 22:14, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

:* Just to amplify what I said earlier about "redirect-cruft": A quick look at '''[[:Category:Redirects from other capitalisations]]''' finds that it contains a mind-boggling '''397,446 redirects''', of which I'll bet at least 99% are completely pointless. And that number doesn't include what must be many more such redirects that exist but aren't linked to the category. We are talking about something on the order of ''half a million redirects'' that could be completely done away with by adopting case-insensitivity. It's a beautiful thing! —&nbsp;'''[[User:Jaydiem|Jaydiem]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:Jaydiem|talk]]) 07:19, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

* '''Support''' These seems like it could solve several conflicts as well. I believe one of the reasons why sentence case article names makes sense is because when articles are linked in sentences it goes to the case linked. If we made them all equivalent it could mean that we could use title case for article names without requiring redirects or pipes in the links. This would allow some of the recent capitalization style differences of opinions to be less important. I think in addition to folding letters, certain symbols should be folded together as well. For example treat "-", "/", "–", and "—" as interchangeable when resolving the page. This means that the correct hyphen, or dash can be used in a title but that it could be found with the standard hyphen-minus character. It could also solve the upper vs lower case first character issue. I'm not sure we need to use 301 or 303 codes. I might suggest making the canonical URL always be the lowercase forum ( etc. ), and just store the preferred capitalization along with the article either internally as a separate data field, or similar to how article names are handled inline for lowercase letters. In which case all interwiki links should always then go to the canonical forum. [[User:PaleAqua|PaleAqua]] ([[User talk:PaleAqua|talk]]) 03:20, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose'''. Instances where disambiguation can be provided entirely via capitalization are not rare - they generally occur when a common noun is appropriated by an organization or creative work as its name. No need to add extra bulk (which also makes wikilinks to those articles more annoying to create as they must be piped). -- [[User:King of Hearts|King of]] [[User:King of Hearts|<font color="red">&hearts;</font>]] [[User talk:King of Hearts|<font color="red">&diams;</font>]] [[Special:Contributions/King of Hearts|<font color="black">&clubs;</font>]] &spades; 03:49, 26 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Oppose''' per King of Hearts; situations in which capitalisation differences are significant are extremely frequent, and this proposal (if I understand rightly) would get rid of all of them.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 18:36, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' The use of capitalization alone is a rather ambiguous form of disambiguation. Other disambiguation conventions, including hat notes and parenthetical suffixes are clearer. The case-sensitive search function has been a minor irritation since I started editing Wikipedia. It would be far better if it behaved like every other computerized search engine and index I've used, which would be the result of article titles becoming case-insensitive. [[User:G. C. Hood|G. C.

== Reporting on Suicide ==

I propose that Wikipedia follow http://reportingonsuicide.org/Recommendations2012.pdf. I saw a couple of articles using successful/unsuccessful when referring to suicide. I don't see any downside to following the guidelines and much upside. [[Special:Contributions/184.77.68.158|184.77.68.158]] ([[User talk:184.77.68.158|talk]]) 21:08, 29 July 2014 (UTC)

* '''Support''' Seems like something that would make sense to be considered in the [[WP:MOS]], etc. [[User:PaleAqua|PaleAqua]] ([[User talk:PaleAqua|talk]]) 21:50, 29 July 2014 (UTC)
* It's not a guideline, but there's a user essay on [[Wikipedia:Articles on suicides|articles]] covering suicides. I think you'll find that some of their suggestions work well with (or as served already by) our content guidelines and practices, but that link could surely be added to the essay (at least) to frame it as a public health issue. [[User:Protonk|Protonk]] ([[User talk:Protonk|talk]]) 21:54, 29 July 2014 (UTC)
* '''Clarification''' Including the considerations such as it being a public health issue certainly sounds like something to include in the essay. I was more focusing on using the term "success" with suicide, which does seem like a Manual of Style issue. Is there a project that might undertake integrating the recommendations as appropriate? [[Special:Contributions/184.77.68.158|184.77.68.158]] ([[User talk:184.77.68.158|talk]]) 23:19, 29 July 2014 (UTC)
*: Maybe [[WP:Wikiproject Biography]] would be a good place to suggest that. As an aside, they recommend how to sidestep "succeed", but how are you supposed to sidestep "failed"/"was unsuccessful" without being unclear about the outcome? "Such and such attempted suicide but survived"? Seems like a weird way to put that. (This sort of discussion can probably go into [[WT:MOS]], of course, but I'm just curious as to what the recommendation is actually supposed to be) [[User:0x0077BE|<font style="color: #0077BE">0x0077BE</font>]] [<sup>[[User talk:0x0077BE|<font color="#0033BE">talk</font>]]</sup>/<sub>[[Special:contributions/0x0077BE|<font color="#0033BE">contrib</font>]]</sub>] 01:38, 30 July 2014 (UTC)
*::I changed the one I saw to "did not die." The alternative might be to describe the actual result like "was hospitalized." There apparently is a [[WP:WPSUICIDE]]. I don't know how active it is.

*::"To attempt" suicide seems adequate. In typical usage, the verb implies, but does not explicitly state that the task attempted has not been completed. It seems that the subject's survival would be clear in biographical articles. In other contexts, one might distinguish an "attempt at suicide" from a "suicide". [[User:G. C. Hood|G. C. Hood]] ([[User talk:G. C. Hood|talk]]) 05:35, 6 August 2014 (UTC)
* {{ec}}I can think of no reason not to include this in the MOS. It probably needs some work on altering from a newspaper emphasis, eg headline guidelines should probably instead be about section headings, and the stuff about quoting first responders or noting trends are certainly not applicable. But a lot of it, like not including pictures of the suicide location, seem like good MOS material. I'd suggest starting up [[WP:Manual of Style/Deaths]] as a proposed member of [[:Category:Wikipedia Manual of Style (content)]], and run an RfC on getting this to guideline status.

*'''Maybe''' While I support that it would be a great idea to add this to [[WP:MOS]], it would need to be done in such a way that it wouldn't compromise the meaning of the article. For example, if there was an article on Hitler, it would be somewhat difficult to avoid the topic of his suicide. Yes, I absolutely agree that wikipedia should be sensitive to this topic, but it should not compromise the integrity of the topic in question. But it would be a good idea to introduce some sort of policy on the mater, so that when these situations arise, there will be a shift to a better method of presenting these sort of situations. [[User:Jab843|Jab843]] ([[User talk:Jab843|talk]]) 02:47, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
*'''Partial support'''. The first, third, and last points on the [http://reportingonsuicide.org/Recommendations2012.pdf "Do this" list] seem reasonable, and agreed terminology would be appropriate for the MOS; however, Wikipedia isn't a broadcaster, and shouldn't be making public health interventions suggested in the second, fourth, or fifth points of the "Do this" list. I oppose omitting factual information, such as the contents of a suicide note or comments from first responders, when that information has been published in reliable sources. I'll also clarify that ideas and opinions of suicide are culturally bound, and that the recommendations consider suicide as a public health problem to be discussed. I caution against the legalized assumption that suicide is a sign of mental illness. In many cultures, and many circumstances, suicide has been accepted as the result of a rational decision. To insist or imply otherwise would be an example of both [[WP:RECENTISM]] and a culturally-specific [[WP:WORLDVIEW]]. [[User:G. C. Hood|G. C. Hood]] ([[User talk:G. C.

== Allow "suppressredirect" and "move-subpages" within userspace ==

I would like to request that autoconfirmed users be granted the '''suppressredirect''' and '''move-subpages''' permissions for moving pages entirely within the subpage hierarchy of their own User: and User talk: pages.

I am aware of [[WP:Perennial proposals#Grant non-admins admin functions within their user space]], but the main objections highlighted there appear to relate to the potential for vandalism committed through nefarious page deletion. This proposal does not have that problem, because (a) it does not grant the ability to delete any pages, and (b) its scope is limited to moves that both originate and terminate within the user's own userspace. This change would significantly benefit those who do a lot of page development in their userspace, and I can't think of any collateral damage that it would cause.

Respectfully submitted, —&nbsp;'''[[User:Jaydiem|Jaydiem]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:Jaydiem|talk]]) 16:00, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
*'''Support''' if it wouldn't require much dev time to implement. Doesn't seem very prone to abuse, trying to imagine how this could be used nefariously, this is the best I can do: Move page you want to hide to userspace, then move it with suppressed redirect to another userspace name, then create a new page where you first moved it, so that the automatic redirect from mainspace would lead to a normal looking page, with no indication of what happened in the page history. The record of the 2nd move would still be fully visible to anyone who bothered to look at the logs for the page, though the log wouldn't be displayed by default once the new page was created. Also, it would be very obvious what happened to anyone with the original page watchlisted. All in all, I think the convenience factor outweighs the rather minimal risks.

*'''Support''' if not too much work for the devs. Also, I presume that these rights would also be enabled in the User talk: space? I.e. to move talk pages of moved articles, to clean up talk page archives etc? [[User:BethNaught|BethNaught]] ([[User talk:BethNaught|talk]]) 16:09, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
:* Yes, absolutely, the intention here is for the same rules to apply in the "User:" and "User talk:" namespaces. I'm adding this to the proposal statement for clarity, thanks. —&nbsp;'''[[User:Jaydiem|Jaydiem]]'''&nbsp;([[User talk:Jaydiem|talk]]) 17:13, 25 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support with concerns''' Seems mostly reasonable. However, and trying to avoid beans here, I can see a possible way that this can be used to trick pages into being deleted under a speedy criteria, that might bypass causal checking and could be tedious to undo. Though I'm not so sure that a would be vandal would have the patience required to do it. [[User:PaleAqua|PaleAqua]] ([[User talk:PaleAqua|talk]]) 06:57, 26 July 2014 (UTC)

* '''Support suppressredirect, oppose move-subpages''' - I would expect that the number of subpages would be small enough to not require a mass-move; and this lends itself to server overloading by bad-intentioned users. suppressredirect, on the other hand, causes almost no problems. [[User:Od Mishehu|עוד&nbsp;מישהו]] [[User talk:Od Mishehu|Od&nbsp;Mishehu]] 20:00, 27 July 2014 (UTC)

*'''Support''' as long as the suppressredirect only works when you've moving a page that's already in userspace; if we move [[Cheese]] to [[User:Jaydiem/Cheese]] (to make an absurd example), [[Cheese]] shouldn't be suppressible, but once you re-move it to [[User:Jaydiem/Paprika]], the cheese title should be suppressible.  I don't expect that this would easily be abusable as Od Mishehu fears, unless it's done by someone who's abusing an unapproved bot to create tons of userspace pages, and that's so unlikely that it would be unhelpful to lose such a feature just for that reason.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 18:46, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
*:Your example is actually a possible abuse scenario: moving [[Cheese]] to [[User:Jaydiem/Cheese]] with redirect and then on to [[User:Jaydiem/Paprika]] without redirect will leave [[Cheese]] as a broken redirect.

== Proposal: limit the extent of automatic archive options to prevent the use of automatic archival in censorship. ==

Within the broad range of subjects in Wikipedia there are those that are some that are more controversial and some that are less controversial; some that have contents that have higher levels of complexity or which could be approached from a variety of different angles and some that have little complexity and which have one clear way in which they would be best explained.  

Wikipedia is also an environment in which numbers of articles are increasing and in which the number of editors is not keeping pace.

At the present time automatic archival bots work in a way that they can comply with requests to archive topics have been untouched for a specified length of time with a potential that the period of time may be very short (I'm not sure if there is ever any lower limit).  They begin to work in talk page situations in which a certain number of sections have been added and, again, the number of sections can be very low.

We are left in a situation in which people can just chose not to reply to and an issue knowing that the bot will act as a censor that places materials in dead topic vaults that are inconducive to further development.  Can bot potentials be limited and/or can information links that are displayed, when a bot is used, connect to sources of information on settings that should be used in various situations?

The good information in [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines]] includes a section on: [[Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines#When_to_condense_pages|When_to_condense_pages]] which says: It is recommended to archive or refactor a page either when it exceeds 75 KB, or has more than 10 main sections.  In the case of controversial or complex topics I think that archial should not begin until 8-10 sections have been added and that subjects should not be archived unless they have been added to in the last 90 days. <small><span class="autosigned">—&nbsp;Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Gregkaye|Gregkaye]] ([[User talk:Gregkaye|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gregkaye|contribs]]) 04:21, 6 August 2014 (UTC)</span></small><!-- Template:Unsigned -->

*Archiving would seem to be an unlikely censorship technique. If implemented as per [[WP:Archive]], the archived material is both unchanged and searchable. The functionality of archiving bots is certainly something that could be discussed, or experimented with, but I don't see a need for new or changed policy at this time. [[User:G. C. Hood|G. C. Hood]] ([[User talk:G. C. Hood|talk]]) 05:43, 6 August 2014 (UTC)
*I have seen people claim that archiving talk pages is "censorship", but invariably such claims were illfounded. First, a dictionary needs to be checked to discover the meaning of "censorship" (it's got nothing to do with a stale discussion or archiving). Second, if a proposed edit does not have consensus, it is not made in the article, and repeating the proposal or resisting the archival of the discussion are not helpful. [[User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq]] ([[User talk:Johnuniq|talk]]) 05:56, 6 August 2014 (UTC)
:*Can you cite where and to what extent the claims are illfounded.  I am not saying that topics are removed from access from Wikipedia but that they ''are'' removed both from active debate and from active talk page locations in which people are more likely to read content.  Would a word other than "censorship" be better used?  In the way the current system works a potential reward is provided to forms of [[Stonewalling]] type activity even with a potential involvement of [[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|Conspiracy of silence]].  The result of inaction can be a more rapid [[sidelining]] ''of'' a raised issue.  No person need be directly involved in exclusion.  A bot does the work automatically.

::*It's not important for this discussion, but "censorship" has a specific meaning (per standard dictionaries), and that meaning is unrelated to the issue described here.

== Words to watch - automatic tools ==

An important manual of style, [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch]], explains what are the words or expressions a editor must use with caution. Many users, especially new users aren't aware to manual of style or don't read it - so it is important to integrate software tools with editing interface so when user use such expression they should be aware to possible problems. 

In [[wm2014:Hackathon|Wikimania hackathon]] we wrote a tool for it: It shows [[Clippy]] when an editor writes one of the "words to watch" (in VisualEditor):
[[File:WeaselClippy.png|800px|center|thumb|Screenshot]]
We would like to ask the community to extend the list of words to watch: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch/Config]] so our tool (and other similar tools) can integrate manuals of styles in the editing interface itself. [[User:ערן|Eran]] ([[User talk:ערן|talk]]) 09:27, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

== Combine welcome with invitation to Adventure ==

New users may get welcomed by a human, often with a template listing guidance articles; but it is now about equally likely that [[User:HostBot]] will invite them to play the [[WP:Adventure]] game; some receive both messages. Both offer some induction to Wikipedia in their different ways. The two will appeal to different cross-sections of editors. Why not make it standard practice to offer both together?

[[User:Noyster/new editor study|A small study]] indicates that human welcomers are not very good at distinguishing "good" from "bad" editors, but that the selection of who gets the Adventure invite doesn't discriminate at all. It could do little harm, then, for the two messages to be combined. A template could be designed to say, in essence: "Welcome! Here are links to wodges of text you can read, or if you prefer here's a link to an interactive game-style activity". Then new editors could decide for themselves which approach would suit them better at the start. The combined template could be sent equally by a human welcomer or by HostBot: best though if the bot could be programmed to only post the template where the talk page was blank, to avoid duplicated welcomes and also avoid inviting already warned vandals.

===Benefits===
*More new editors given a list of guidance to read.
*More new editors offered participation in the Adventure.
*New editors get the chance to choose between these two contrasting ways to start learning about WP.

===Drawbacks===
*Can Adventure cope with extra traffic, including from some whom the HostBot programmers may not have chosen to invite?
*A welcome from HostBot doesn't offer a human point of contact (though [[WP:Teahouse]] invites ''do'' offer this).
*Development work to design a series of "Welcome/Adventure" templates.
*Need to inform anyone who does welcoming.

*'''Support''' - good idea!!! I am all for it!!!....point I like to make just for a debate see what other think.... [[Wikipedia:Contributing to Wikipedia]] is the best place to start in my opinion (The parent article if you will). It leads to all other intro pages, thus editors can decide which way they wish to learn. Very hard to get people to keep clicking to other pages to learn the way some may prefer.  A static page where editors can chose the topic to review (like "Images" or "Citing sources")...I think is best. All  that said the idea above and adding "The Adventure" to {{tl|Welcome}} and its many variations [[Wikipedia:Welcome templates]] can only help editors in the long run. --[[User:Moxy|Moxy]] ([[User talk:Moxy|talk]]) 13:18, 7 August 2014 (UTC)

:Do you mean at the top left of the page?

Anyways, it would be helpful because it would improve usability: the Contributions will be easier to find (at the very least for non-veterans) and are better accessible from more locations.

:::What Nyttend means to ask you is this:  Is getting a very prominent, duplicate user "Contributions" tab important enough to you to have the page "History" tab hidden for many users?  Re-size your browser window to make it narrow, and wait a second or two.  You'll see the history tab disappear (also "New section", for pages that have that tab) when the screen gets too narrow to display them all.

Not sure where to post this. Could someone think up a way of stopping the invitation bot from inviting users who are indefinitely blocked from taking part in the Adventure?

::Yo! So, I am aware that this has occurred, and it's generally a case of replication lag with the logging table (which HostBot checks for blocks before inviting).

''However'', I'm not sure that this is a particularly pressing issue, because:
::*A) as far as I know, it's ''very'' rare. HostBot has been inviting 100+ editors to the Teahouse ''every day'' for over two years now. The process for checking for blocked/banned users before inviting is the same for TH invites as TWA invites. Errors like this are generally pointed out on my talkpage. I don't get them often--maybe once every 4-5 months or so. 
::*B) HostBot hasn't sent any TWA invites out for almost three months (for unrelated reasons). The last time TWA invites were sent was May 19th. So, I'm guessing you were looking through stale, blocked userpages for other reasons, and happened upon an instance of this? Or, was it a more recent invite, from a human editor?

== Patrol edits that remove more than 500 characters ==

Proposal: if an editor who's not a reviewer or admin removes more than 500 characters, mark such edits and patrol them. Even patrolling edits by such users if more than 1000 characters were removed would be a most welcome change. Things like [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_judoka&diff=606470032&oldid=605317543 this] should not go unnoticed for more than three months. The section wasn't blanked there (so it wasn't tagged) and a bot made an edit approx. 2:04 hours later which meant the vandalistic edit was no longer the latest revision. --[[Special:Contributions/82.136.210.153|82.136.210.153]] ([[User talk:82.136.210.153|talk]]) 12:19, 6 August 2014 (UTC)

::I think the idea has merit. While I do not have the technical skills to do the check, it shouldn't be hard to figure out how many edits fall into this category. I would even consider making the threshold 1000 characters by anyone who is not yet confirmed or autoconfirmed. If there are thousands in a week and most are false positives, yes it will become useless, but my guess is there won't be that many. My bigger concern is the possible incidence of false positives, where a new user accidentally removes something, then fixes it immediately. If that is common, then false positives may dominate the list.--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 14:10, 11 August 2014 (UTC)


Really I see no reason to be more vigilant about large removals than large additions.  Actually, the latter may need ''more'' attention, because someone dumping a large quantity of borderline nonsense into an article is less likely to be summarily reverted by any passerby than a testing-style deletion of a random chunk of text.<br>
This does bring up another point.  The problem with the current numbers that show up in the watchlist is that they show you only the ''net'' change in the number of bytes.  So if someone, say, replaces a good paragraph by a nonsense paragraph of equal length, the change shows up as 0, and people may pass it by assuming that it's a punctuation change or something.
What I would like to see is the magnitude of the diffs, both positive and negative.  In other words, if the diff adds 123 characters and subtracts 122, then we would see (+123)(-122) in the watchlist line, instead of (+1). --[[User:Trovatore|Trovatore]] ([[User talk:Trovatore|talk]]) 14:24, 11 August 2014 (UTC)

:Yes, the addition of more text is more of a problem than removal. 99% of the "large addition edits" I see on my watchlist from either IP editors or usernames I don't recognise are copyvio issues.

==Show article quality to readers?==

What do people think of showing article quality measurements besides GA and FA to readers on the main article page? It's useful information for readers, as it gives them a rough estimate of how "good" the article actually is. For example, I know I would be more likely to read a B-class article than a start-class article when browsing, or I'd be more likely to trust an A-class article for accuracy than even a GA-class article. [[User:StringTheory11|StringTheory11]] ([[User talk:StringTheory11|t]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/StringTheory11|c]]) 05:41, 9 August 2014 (UTC)
:The last discussion on A-class on this board is at [[WP:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_110#Restrict_A_class_usage]]. That has a variety of viewpoints to get us started.

:I never understood why A-class articles don't get a topicon; I suppose a possible reason is that readers can surmise that FA>GA, but not necessarily that A>GA, which seems to me to be a valid but weird system. As for lower ratings, it just creates loads of work updating it, not to mention that often ratings are out of date, or some projects have (for whatever reason, whether specialised criteria or more regular reviews) different ratings.

:: In my experience, these quality tags are so randomly and carelessly assigned that they are typically all but useless. I've repeatedly had "start" class tags slammed on articles of my own that were perfectly sourced, perfectly correct and perfectly relevant, albeit relatively short, by drive-by taggers who had evidently hardly even read the article. I'd be strongly opposed to giving these tags higher visibility than they have now, unless we also introduce some measure of accountability for the taggers and an expectation that quality tags should regularly come with an explicit and testable assessment of the relevant criteria somewhere.

:::I have to agree with Future Perfect, most assessments are not worth the electrons they are printed with.  In large part this is because the majority of assessments are performed by "reviewers" operating at a rate of 4 to 8 articles/minute in 50 to 200 article bursts.  At these rate of speed, it is not reasonable to assume the reviewer has even loaded the article being assessed, let alone that the articles being assessed were read. --''[[User: Allen3|Allen3]]''&nbsp;<sup>[[User talk:Allen3|talk]]</sup> 12:49, 9 August 2014 (UTC)

*Stub-class is noted on the page already. Start-class through B-class are essentially unstandardized and aren't helpful to display.

:I think this is a good idea, but only if the classes are more standardized. Specifically, for each class rating, I'd like to see at least an explanatory edit summary, stating why the article's class was changed. This could take the form of explaining issues the reviewer had with the article, for example. For controversial situations I'd like to see a quality scale assessment on the talk page, going by the criteria for each class. But for that we'd need to set down clear criteria saying what C-class is, what Start-class is, etc. Currently I don't see any list of criteria below B-class.
:I also think that A-class is a bit weird honestly. There is this requirement of having a review, but that is only practical for the largest WikiProjects. And even so, you may not get a review, because you don't get the sticker of prestige. And who aims for A-class as a goal in itself, instead of as a stop on the gruelling road to FA?
:I am intrigued by the B+-class label. WP Maths, WP Stats, and WP Elements use it (there may be more). But I find the part of it on [[WP:1.0/A]] stating "Possible good article nominee" very weird. It defines a class in terms of another class and kind of reduces B+ to just "ready for GA". Does it usually get independent usage?
:I kind of see the point of fine distinctions like we have now, but without clear criteria they aren't going to be useful. I submit that there's really only five really important levels at the moment: Stub/Start/B/GA/FA. The first two are a mess or very short. B is the first level where you have a coherent piece that really adequately describes the topic – I don't see the point of C when the point where an article is substantial is very subjective, and the rest is similar to Start.
:A has clearly defined criteria, but is rarely used. I get the impression it's not found to be useful, and its position between GA and FA is perhaps counterintuitive. Perhaps A might be useful if you have distinctions between "FA in content level" and "FA in style level" (I used to think those were A and GA), but while doing the latter alone is easy (come on, look at some obscure FAs which didn't get good peer review from [[User:TCO/Improving Wikipedia's important articles|TCO's infamous study]]), doing the former alone kind of does the latter for you because otherwise your content is incomprehensible. (OK, barring citation format, punctuation, etc. which most readers as opposed to researchers do not honestly care about.)
:As for B, there is little social reward for this one, even though work to get Stub/Start to B is valuable to our readers. It's not a sticker that people like to post on their userpages, maybe because there isn't a review (although there should be IMHO). [[WP:Four Award]] has DYK/GA/FA: I don't get why new article and DYK are counted separately, because they will generally follow together because of the time limit. And en.wiki's DYK is kind of odd: it's more of an editorial service than a reader's one. The hooks are not always interesting (examples can be provided upon request: thanks to [[User:R8R Gtrs|R8R Gtrs]] by the way for pointing this out!), and it's hard to make it so for some articles: so to make every article have that chance, you sometimes have to sacrifice hook interestingness. But it's on the main page! Surely readers are important too? And it's for this reason that I've tried to make my few hooks interesting, to make readers want to  click the link because they are genuinely curious.
:But DYK is kind of outside the class scheme. Maybe it would serve very well as a low-class review status, to be the step before B. But I don't see this happening all the time.
:This was supposed to be a one-paragraph short post. I don't know what happened: the tale must have grown in the telling. I do hope I tied all the loose ends together, though. Also note that I'm primarily a [[WP:ELEM|WP Elements]] member, which may colour my views because it works on [[WP:VITAL|vital articles]] (level 4) for the most part. Perhaps an interesting case study is [[WP:Chemicals]] with a simplified A/B/Start/Stub scheme. It says "Although the Wikiproject does acknowledge the Wikipedia status of Featured Article (FA) and Good Article (GA), these are generic qualifications only, with no specific attention for chemical completeness, and as such are not listed in our Classes." This leads me to wonder if each project should really implement more specific criteria, to supplement or replace the general ones.

::I definitely agree with you that C-class is really hard to nail down. In my mind a short blurb is a stub (though the assessment systems says a really bad longer article can be so classified), Start is basically a work in progress (either incomplete or poorly referenced), and then B is a basically complete article that hasn't undergone a peer review process. That leaves C as basically a better start class article.

:::The benefit of A-class, for those projects that use it, is that it notes the article is up to the standards of ''the associated wikiproject''. Whether that should actually be how things work or not, I have no idea, but it's the functional meaning. I suspect the idea behind 'B+' is similar: it marks the article as reviewed by editors who are involved in the subject. (Whereas GA-class requires external review.) Thanks to the at times months-long waits articles have on GAN, and then the additional delays once reviews start due to e.g. copyediting stuff, I can see the appeal of a preliminary review and associated grading. --[[User:erachima|erachima]] <small>[[User talk:erachima|talk]]</small> 23:14, 9 August 2014 (UTC)
::::{{ping|erachima}} I can definitely see the appeal of that, but it seems as though for all but the largest WikiProjects there is no such review process and grading. [[WP:ELEM|WP Elements]] used to have them for A and B, but after a while they became inactive. That seems to be the problem. For the average WikiProject, I submit that you really only need A/B/Start/Stub, with FA and GA as external general ratings. Maybe even a detailed review isn't necessary for all WikiProjects: just an edit summary explaining the rerating (although the detailed review should definitely be posted if it gets requested). That's what I did when I rerated the WP:ELEM articles a few days ago.
::::Also, if the ratings differ from project to project, does showing them as topicons really help the reader (as opposed to the editor) gauge its quality? GA and FA are general ratings, so those do help the reader, but I question if showing the rest as topicons would help if they are specific to one WikiProject or another. And what if an article is under multiple WikiProjects and is rated differently by them?

:::::B-class requires the article to meet [[Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Assessment/B-Class criteria|six criteria]]. If an article only meets four or five of those, but is close, it's C-class. For example, if an article is very thorough and informative, but has large unreferenced sections or a confusing layout, it would be C-class. A B-class article could probably get through GAN but may need a peer review first. A C-class article would probably fail GAN right away. A start-class article is nowhere near the B-class criteria. —[[User:Designate|Designate]] ([[User talk:Designate|talk]]) 13:15, 10 August 2014 (UTC)
::::::I agree with you here: that's what C and Start generally mean right now. But I submit that defining them only in relation to what B-class criteria they fail isn't a very good a definition. They should have criteria of their own. And from a reader's point of view, C and Start are after all both kind of unsatisfactory (Start is "most readers will need more", C is "Useful to a casual reader" only), especially for more technical topics when C wouldn't be very good at helping people understand the content!
::::::Also, I think that if the layout is confusing, then an average reader wouldn't find it "very thorough and informative", simply because the info is hard to find. [[User:Double sharp|Double sharp]] ([[User talk:Double sharp|talk]]) 19:50, 10 August 2014 (UTC)

Also thinking a little about B-class. On the one hand, it has clear criteria and gives the reader good (but not great) content. And getting a  lower-class article to B does a great service to the reader, especially since many important articles are not of this quality (e.g. [[gold]] is C-class, mostly because it is kind of a mess.) But this is not rewarded. [[User:TCO|TCO]] wrote [[User:TCO/Improving Wikipedia's important articles|here]] "Still a little worried at the low social rewards for B and probably the lower stability of B class articles to [degradation]. I would like to see the top 1000 Vital at GA+ and also all the elements because of the benefits of review."

Given this, I think that we should have B-class review available for WikiProjects large enough to cope with it, just like A-class review, and that ideally those classes get topicons as well. B+, I don't know. It is not a standard class, and many large WikiProjects have shown that they don't need it. Nevertheless three WikiProjects (IIRC, Mathematics, Statistics, Elements) have implemented it (Elements as late as 2011). If it gets reviewed as well, I think it could also work.

But there would need to be a caveat for the reader for A, B+, and B stating the existence of different standards among different WikiProjects. [[User:Double sharp|Double sharp]] ([[User talk:Double sharp|talk]]) 12:33, 12 August 2014 (UTC)
:Pretty much the only reason I don't use B+ myself is that it breaks the tables like the one at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Astronomy/Article ratings]]. If support for the class was implemented in these tables, I would probably start using it, since I see it as a class that basically says: "this article is at the point where a GAN alone could address the problems necessary to bring it to GA".

I don't think there is value to our users in hat-noting B-class articles, because the B-class assessment covers so little that is not obvious to the casual reader. Consider the B-class criteria for a moment, which essentially read
#Page offers some basic attempt at sourcing.
#Page does not have glaring omissions.
#Page is not a disorganized infodump.
#Page is not grammatically incomprehensible.
#Page has appropriate organizational templates.
#Page is not a mass of jargon.
Now, of these criteria, how many convey "hidden information" of some sort to our readers? Generally only the first, though in some technical subjects the second may also require a bit of expertise to judge. The remaining criteria are simply a checklist of ways an article may ''very obviously'' suck. As a result, telling a reader that they are reading a B-class page communicates almost nothing to them that will not be immediately apparent on reading the article itself.<br />Where B-class is useful is almost wholly on the metadata side, where it can tell editors interested in a broad subject which articles are and are not at a level of basic presentability.<br />As to the "social reward" aspect of giving reader-visible announcements, I believe this is a red herring. There are two main routes to B, in my observation. The first is when a page rockets straight from non-existent or stub to B, and most of our writers who can crank out pages like that are perfectly capable of self-assessing when a page is B-grade. Many don't necessarily even bother with having it checked for B before putting it in the GAN queue, and I'm not considering that a flaw. In this context, you'd basically just be giving the writers an extra no-prize for having a draft of the article they're trying to write finished.<br />The other is when a page has grown organically via the traditional method of everyone who read the page for the last 8 years chipping in a couple sentences, which tends to create pages that have all the necessary factual content for B-grade but are a disorganized mess. In these cases, the reward aspect should already be satisfied: intrinsically speaking, the editor gets to enjoy knowing that it's by their efforts that the page is now essentially readable, and extrinsically, their work was acknowledged by another editor.<br />In conclusion, publicly visible announcements of article quality are useful to readers only to the extent that they convey ''hidden information'' about the page's quality. This is true for the FA process and true for the GA process. It is also in most cases true for A-class, though I suspect that for political and practical reasons a rebranding of A (EA? HA?) with a clearer and more unified associated process may be necessary before it attains community consensus as a recognized category. B/C/Start, however, lack this trait and should therefore be considered purely metadata. --[[User:erachima|erachima]] <small>[[User talk:erachima|talk]]</small> 15:08, 13 August 2014 (UTC)

Two systems are currently used for the disambiguation of placenames.

Any set of entities of the same type by the same name can be compiled as a disambiguation page (unless the [[WP:DABRL]] guideline is in the way, but that's a whole other can of worms). A set index approach is only used when inclusion of additional metadata and references (otherwise prohibited by [[WP:MOSDAB]]) is deemed to add value and where there is a WikiProject willing to handle set index-specific maintenance. These conditions are met for ships, mountains, anthroponymic lists, chemical elements, and yes, Russian placenames, among other things. Any other WikiProject can come on board or jump overboard at any time; there really isn't anything in the guidelines to either encourage or discourage that, nor should there be, IMO.—[[User:Ezhiki|Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)]]&nbsp;•&nbsp;([[User talk:Ezhiki|yo?]]); <span class="nowrap">August 21, 2014</span>; 19:57 (UTC)

== [[Template:ExcessiveCitations]] ==

I was reading {{oldid|page=Opinion polling for the Scottish independence referendum, 2014|oldid=620748296|label=this revision}} of [[Opinion polling for the Scottish independence referendum, 2014]], and I noticed that the ‘School, college and university surveys’ section contained 31 citations for one sentence in a way that was at odds with [[Wikipedia:Citation overkill]].  I did not want to spend the time going through the many citations in that section to see which ones were necessary for that particular statement and which ones weren't, so I thought I would flag the section with a template saying that the section contained an excessive number of citations and that disreputable or unnecessary references should be removed.  To my surprise, however, there was no such template, so I decided to make one.  I did so, added it to the article, and then added it to [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup/Verifiability and sources]].  A user, however, found some aspects of it ‘highly questionable’, and so removed it from the template messages page.  He also asked whether there was a consensus behind it, and since there was none, I decided to attempt to establish one.  What do you guys think of [[Template:ExcessiveCitations]]?  We have message templates for virtually every other problem with references or citations (e.g. none, unreliable, more needed, not properly formatted, broken, not used properly), so why not include this one? [[User:Esszet|Esszet]] ([[User talk:Esszet|talk]]) 22:42, 12 August 2014 (UTC)
: I dunno.  Seems legit to me.  I might use it, but I'm more likely to just cull the unnecessary or unreliable citations.  In pop culture articles, they're usually very obvious.  [[Discogs]], [[IMDB]], [[Rotten Tomatoes]], and [[AllRovi]] seem to be the worst offenders.  It's a simple matter to move them to the external links, where they belong.  For offline sources, this template would be useful. [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]] ([[User talk:NinjaRobotPirate|talk]]) 00:46, 14 August 2014 (UTC)

: Sounds like a good idea as I suspect many editors have never heard of [[WP:CITEKILL]]. That said, I think it should be an inline template only{{ndash}}putting a big box at the top of the page saying "This article may contain an excessive number of citations" is potentially dangerous (e.g. the claim "''But it said at the top of the article that I had to remove the citations ..."'') Instead, we should take a rifle (as opposed to a shotgun) approach with the flag at the end of the "offending" sentence/paragraph. By using a dated category, those so inclined can go through the backlog as and when.

:::It's definitely a problem.  It's bad enough in an academic paper: when you cite more than one thing at once, it's not easy to tell what came from where.  However, in such a context, you're typically instructed to be engaging in original research, interpreting what's said.  In a context like Wikipedia, where we must say only what's in a source, there's almost never a good reason to cite more than one source for a specific sentence, and the exceptions are situations where we're discussing the sources themselves, e.g. "Alice and Bob say X"<nowiki><ref>Alice's book</ref><ref>Bob's article</ref></nowiki>.  Whenever we're simply talking about the subject, a single source will pretty much always be sufficient, so in pretty much every situation of this sort, we can simply chop all the other sources, although of course we might have to examine the process of adding the sources in case there really is original research.  That's why [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=621997347&oldid=621422910 I'll cut additional sources]; if one WP:RS for a statement says everything (especially online, so I can check it), I'll chop everything else, since there's already sufficient sourcing.

*I wouldn't deny that there is such a thing as citation overkill, but placing a template on an article encouraging editors to remove citations is bad, bad, bad.  Some analysis of why there are too many citations is required.  Frequently, multiple cites to the same fact is indicative that edit warring has been going on and someone is trying to prove a point by weight of citations.  The real solution here is to resolve the dispute and reach a consensus.  Removing the citations does not solve the problem.  Even more commonly, there are multiple citations because some [[WP:SYNTH]] is going on, for example, "most/many scientists think..." followed by numerous scientists taking that position.  Actually, what is needed here is not removal of citations, but rather {{tl|citation needed}} for the synthesis that most scientists believe that.  When ''that'' citation is provided ''then'' the old ones become redundant.  Alternatively, the whole passage needs to go along with its citations.
:I also have some objections to the specific wording of the template.  Calling for disreputable sources to be removed is wrong.  No, the disreputable source remains the source of the passage.  The correct actions are either to tag it with {{tl|unreliable source inline}}, {{tl|dubious}}, or something similar, or else to remove the passage altogether.  I also don't think much of the call to merge references, by which I think is meant [[WP:BUNDLING|citation bundling]].  This does not fix the overkill problem, it just moves it further down to the references section.
:More generally, a call to delete references without explicitily identifying the problem items, and why they are a problem, is liable to result in the ''wrong things'' getting deleted.  In short, this was a good faith idea, but ultimately counter-productive.

== Watchlists and transclusions ==

I have a suggestion for a bot. The issue it is meant to address is as follows. I have transcluded the lead of an article B into another article A using [[Wikipedia:Transclusion#Partial_transclusion]]. But changes to the lead of B do not show up as changes in the watchlist for article A. There seems to be no way to get around this, to alert people of the changes, short of keeping B in the watchlist as well.

I have an idea for reflecting transclusions. Each time the lead changes on article B, a bot adds a whitespace in the odd iteration, (or removes the whitespace in an even iteration) in article A with the edit summary mentioning the diff. Assuming there are not too many transclusions, and that the transcluded section is not changed too many times, this should not be too much of a problem. Any suggestions on whether this is a good idea? If so, I would be interested in writing such a bot myself, though I don't have any experience in such things.

== Bot to keep up to date lists of active and inactive members of WikiProjects ==

Members list of WikiProjects tend to grow steadily and are crippled with inactive members. The consequence is that when you add your name in the list, you don't really feel like you are getting involved in anything significant, because it means next to nothing to be in the list.

It is not a very rewarding job to clean these lists by hand but that's how it's done in many WikiProjects. Some tools such as [[User:Dispenser|Dispenser]]'s [[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/useractivity.py|useractivity.py]] can help but they are not very convenient when it comes to performing the edit itself: lines containing inactive users are simply commented out, which is not suitable if your members list is actually a table, or if you want to store inactive members in another list.

I propose to write a bot to do this task. Actually, most of the code is written.
It can update the participants list of your WikiProject (but will not unless you request it for your own WikiProject). The update consists in moving inactive participants listed in the "active list" to the "inactive list" of your WikiProject. You can define what an "inactive participant" is. It supports both lists and tables.

For instance, it can mark participants as inactive when:
* their last contribution to the English Wikipedia is older than some threshold (typically one year)
* their last contribution to a page (or its talk page) falling in the scope of your WikiProject is too old
* their last edit to a page inside the WikiProject itself is too old (discussions about the project itself, the portal, and so on)

You choose what is relevant for your project.
It can also sort the two lists of members (active and inactive) by user name if it is told so. And it can move inactive users who are actually active again to the list of active users.

Would you find it useful? I can also propose this code as an external tool, but I think it would be simpler for everyone to run it as a bot.
Your feature requests are welcome. If there is a consensus here, I will post a request for bot approval. − [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|talk]]) 11:57, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
:This would be very useful I think. These lists are now mostly cemeteries of former editors (or user names). [[User:Johnbod|Johnbod]] ([[User talk:Johnbod|talk]]) 12:02, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
* I think if you supported a config script, like they have for archiving bots, and had the bot limit itself to the section in which the script is found, that would make it a lot more user-friendly. I also think it would be good to check for users that are blocked, in addition to simply inactive.

::Checking for blocked users might not be such a good idea as it looked at first. A significant number of blocks are for just hours or days, some of the longer ones are reversed and some are succesfully appealed. We'd have flurries of bot activity changing lists to and fro, and anyone looking to the lists for helpful editors might not realise that an editor listed as blocked could soon be back in action. Short-term blocks might come to be resented more if they were seen as damaging participation in projects. Maybe simply looking for inactivity would be enough. [[User:NebY|NebY]] ([[User talk:NebY|talk]]) 20:04, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
:::It's a good idea to use templates, I will do that. Concerning blocked users, it shouldn't be hard to implement, but I quite agree with [[User:NebY|NebY]]. Anyway, I don't think the bot has to do frequent changes to the lists. For most projects it should be fine if their members list is a few weeks old. [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|talk]]) 20:16, 17 August 2014 (UTC)
:I'd be happy to see this done.  However, the participant lists involve a wide variety of locations and formats, so it's unlikely that whatever you create will work for all of them. 
:I'd start with the simplest case:  no edits at all for at least one year. [[User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing]] ([[User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk]]) 15:16, 18 August 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for your support! The most difficult part is to handle the different formats of lists or tables indeed. Clearly, some formats won't be handled, but I believe for some projects it might be worth changing a bit their habits to get something automated. But I will not force them to do so, of course. [[User:Pintoch|Pintoch]] ([[User talk:Pintoch|talk]]) 16:00, 18 August 2014 (UTC)
: I think the usefulness of such a bot would be reduced if the criteria for marking members as "inactive" were not consistent between projects. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 14:15, 23 August 2014 (UTC)
:::'''Support''' I strongly support the creation of such a bot. There are a number of tasks I do which involve going to a Wikiproject I'm not familiar with (example, fielding an OTRS info request) Sometimes I post to the talk page, but I would prefer to make a request to an active member. That is often a tedious task. Restricting myself to a list of active members would be very helpful.
:::However, I do have a different view regarding  the notion that the criteria need to be consistent. I'll illustrate with [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Basketball/Women's basketball]] (I do realize, with only 9 members, the bot is a bit of overkill). I would find it useful to know if any of the members  become inactive, and I like the second option. I imagine that the list of participants would be changed to active participants, and the bot would move inactive down to a section, which could easily state "Inactive means the editor has not edited a basketball article in six months). If some other Wikiproject prefers a different criteria, they could state it at the top of the list of inactive members.--[[User:Sphilbrick|<span style="color:#002868;padding:0 4px;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">S Philbrick</span>]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|<span style=";padding:0 4px;color:# 000;font-family: Copperplate Gothic Light">(Talk)</span>]] 15:23, 23 August 2014 (UTC)
*I could support this idea, but it needs to be done with some sensitivity.  Members marked as inactive should not have their membership of the Wikiproject removed, for instance, they should remain in Wikiproject categories (but possibly a sub-category).  The bot should automatically put them back in the active member list just as quickly once they start editing again.  It should be on an opt-in basis, not foisted on Wikiprojects without discussion.

* The useractivity tool became an information table as it wasn't conveyed well in lists nor should ephemeral info be constantly saved.  I spent some time restoring functionlity, it still badly hurt from labs migration (like [[bugzilla:68876|Bug 68876]]).  Additions I'd like to see in the future is their sub-specialty, best method of communication (e.g. IRC or wiki), and a user invitation system.  — [[User:Dispenser|Dispenser]] 14:03, 27 August 2014 (UTC)

=== Background (Persondata) ===
The question keeps arising on [[Wikipedia talk:Persondata]] and other forums on whether we should drop persondata now that Wikidata provides the same or similar information.  I usually state eventually that is the goal, but I haven't heard anything else about it.  I decided this time to be more proactive about it.

From [[Wikipedia:Persondata]], {{tq|"Persondata is a special set of metadata that can and should be added to biographical articles only. It consists of standardized data fields with basic information about the person (name, short description, birth and death days, and places of birth and death) that, unlike conventional Wikipedia content, can be extracted automatically and processed by cataloging tools and then used for a variety of purposes, such as providing advanced search capabilities, statistical analysis, automated categorization, and birthday lists."}}

At this time, I'm not aware of anyone using the data.  [[DBpedia]] does gather the information and offers it for [http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads39#h283-1 download].  However, I'm not aware that they use it.  Wikidata did have two bots running, which copied {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} from persondata and put it into Wikidata.  One bot worked only on dewiki.  [[:wikidata:User:SamoaBot|SamoaBot]] did work on enwiki.  SamoaBot's operator stated that he doesn't {{tq|"...recall having run that task in these months. However, tons of data have already been imported, and now it is up to the English Wikipedia community to decide whether they still want those data within articles."}}  I did [[:Wikidata:Wikidata:Project_chat#removal_of_persondata|ask Wikidata]] about persondata.

{{tl|Persondata}} does have [[User:Pigsonthewing/Persondata|many drawbacks]].  Some of which are:
# It is hidden, therefore it is often out of sync with the article text or infobox, with no current mechanism to keep it in sync.
# If an infobox is present, persondata becomes redundant.
# It is currently not being used by anybody (to my knowledge).
# {{para|NAME}} and {{para|ALTERNATIVE NAME}} parameters have no standard format.   Format should be surname, firstname, but this isn't always followed.  When a person as a stage/pen name, there is not standard on which parameter parameter gets what name.

Positives:
# If the article doesn't have an infobox, persondata can become a source of info.
# {{para|SHORT DESCRIPTION}} is of use to Wikidata.
# From [[User talk:Periglio#Persondata|Periglio's talk page]], {{tq|"Wikipedia has an easy accessible database of over 1 million people. It is data available for serious research projects. Why delete it?"}}

'''Question:''' Should the {{tl|persondata}} template be removed from all articles and no longer be used?

Proposed by {{U|Bgwhite}} 21:21, 20 July 2014 (UTC)

===Discussion (Persondata) ===
* '''''Have a comment?'''''
*Before implementing this change all the gadgets and tools that create or use this template must also be changed.  Otherwise we will get them being created when others are trying to get rid of them.  A comparable situation where the cite gadget creates "deprecated" cite template parameters that bot(s) go around undoing. So this should be done as a proper release, where wikidata, gadgets and tools are all synchronised with the policy implementation to stop wasted effort. [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 22:08, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
*:{{U|Graeme Bartlett}}, Wikidata is currently not ingesting anything from Persondata.  I'm aware of two tools that create Persondata, [[Wikipedia:Persondata-o-matic|Persondata-o-matic]] and AWB.  An AWB developer is aware of this proposal.  Persondata-o-matic currently doesn't work.  There are some scripts/gadgets that do allow for easy viewing persondata. [[User:Bgwhite|Bgwhite]] ([[User talk:Bgwhite|talk]]) 22:17, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
*::So I think that Wikidata should ingest this.  It will be harder to harvest from history as it may not be possible to tell the "correct" version. AFC reviewer tool currently adds persondata. [[User:Graeme Bartlett|Graeme Bartlett]] ([[User talk:Graeme Bartlett|talk]]) 06:02, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

*If this goes ahead, someone (I'm willing to help) will need to close up the [[Wikipedia:Persondata|Persondata]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Persondata|WikiProject Persondata]] and related pages. Also maybe notify members of the project (and places like [[WP:BIOG]]) that persondata is going to be removed. Is there a way of setting up an ongoing bot to send messages to users who add new persondata?—[[User:Msmarmalade|Msmarmalade]] ([[User talk:Msmarmalade|talk]]) 08:09, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

*[[User:Rjwilmsi]]'s bot occasionally adds/updates Persondata using AWB but it should be very easy to diactivate AWB's after we agree to stop adding/remove Persondata. -- [[User:Magioladitis|Magioladitis]] ([[User talk:Magioladitis|talk]]) 08:24, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

*[[Wikipedia:WikiProject Biography]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Infoboxes]] about this discussion. -- [[User:Magioladitis|Magioladitis]] ([[User talk:Magioladitis|talk]]) 08:27, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

*My main concern is [[:Category:Biography articles without infoboxes]]. This means we have 20,000+ that may have Persondata and not an infobox. -- [[User:Magioladitis|Magioladitis]] ([[User talk:Magioladitis|talk]]) 08:40, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
*:Maybe it would be a good idea to add infoboxes to most of these pages so that we reserve the information in the article and in a visible place? -- [[User:Magioladitis|Magioladitis]] ([[User talk:Magioladitis|talk]]) 16:40, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
*::{{Ping|Magioladitis}} do you mean automatically create infoboxes and transfer Persondata to them? One consideration in that case then, is articles where there isn't enough information to justify an infobox (Although I'd like to see almost every page with an infobox anyway, I think the general consensus is that infoboxes without enough info are an eyesore). For example, if only {{para|NAME}} is available, the infobox is unnecessary as you can (usually) get that info from the article title. Perhaps these sorts of persondata can be deleted early on.—[[User:Msmarmalade|Msmarmalade]] ([[User talk:Msmarmalade|talk]]) 02:34, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
*:::{{Ping|Msmarmalade}} we can select some rules (size of page, at least 3 fields are filled, etc.) and create infoboxes using a bot only for these cases. Still much better than now. -- [[User:Magioladitis|Magioladitis]] ([[User talk:Magioladitis|talk]]) 05:02, 24 July 2014 (UTC)

*How reliable is Persondata anyway? in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jake_Barton&diff=prev&oldid=617591671 this edit] a malformed article title was used to create a malformed NAME, and DATE OF BIRTH was copied from the completely unsourced infobox (it's not present in the body of the article). Where does that leave Persondata - or Wikidata if it scrapes up "information" using the same rules?

* '''Questions''' - Perhaps it's just me, but there seems to be a failure of communications at work here. Even now, many WP editors remain in the dark about what Wikidata is doing, and how it will affect WP articles. In this example, for instance, would the supplantation of persondata by corresponding wikidata yield better WP articles? Will it, for instance, automatically populate WP infoboxes? What would the differences look like? How would they be made compliant with BLP, V, and other WP policies? Would WP editors still be able to correct errors, without having to learn their way around Wikidata? Are there some examples in place to show how these things will operate? [[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] <small>[[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|<font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font>]]</small> 20:40, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
*:{{ping|LeadSongDog}}. Some data in the infoboxes could be fetched from Wikidata, but that does not seeem to be the matter at hand here. {{tl|Persondata}} is not meant to be used to populate infoboxes. -[[user:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]]
*::Thanks, but that really doesn't clear much up. The content of {{tl|Persondata}}, {{tl|Infobox person}}, etc should reasonably be automagically verifiable against the categories the article is put into. References supporting the assertions that cause those categories to be applied must be maintained if we are to avoid finding [[Koffi Annan]] in Category:Bollywood stars or something equally absurd. Will/does wikidata support checks to see that the categories are supported in the article, with references? Does it have a mechanism to support variances in sourcing policies between the different WP languages, or at least to attribute the sourcing to the WP language and article where the assertion originates? Vandalism isn't going to be disappearing anytime soon, after all. [[User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog]] <small>[[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|<font color="red" face="Papyrus">come howl!</font>]]</small> 21:53, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
*:::I do not really understand what you are talking about. This proposal is not about deleting {{tl|Infobox person}} and afaik, there is no consistency check between persondata and categories. Actually, I do not see how a bot could use Persondata in their current form to know that Koffi Annan should not be categorized as a Bollywood star.
*:::Many bots have added from which Wikipedia the data originated in the source part of the statement. One has added the actual reference that was used in the article (but this is more difficult so less widely implemented at the moment). --07:16, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

*{{comment}} There actually appears to be actually two issues: 
*#should we work toward removing Persondata now ? 
*#should we delete data from Persondata wtihout checkign with have their data in Wikidata first ?~
:I am certainly in favour of 1), not of 2): if data in persondata match those in Wikidata, they can be deleted. It is a bit pointless that when we want to correct some data, we need to do it in two pages instead of one. But when there are gaps in Wikidata/mismatch with persondata, it should be checked before deleting anything. --[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 07:16, 22 July 2014 (UTC)
*:In that case, perhaps we should have a {{tld|persondata moved to Wikdiata}} which can be applied (by humans or bots) once the data is verified as being in Wikidata. It should prevent further addition of Persondata, and enable us to check progress statistics. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn">[[User:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett]]</span> (<span class="nickname">Pigsonthewing</span>); [[User talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy]]; [[Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits]]</span> 10:27, 22 July 2014 (UTC)
*::Once the data is in Wikidata, I think we can simply delete it, so we would rather need {{tld|Persondata inconsistent with Wikidata}}. At the same time, we should obviously stop creating new persondata here. That means, among other things, updating scripts like [[User talk:Dr pda/persondata.js]] by [[user:Dr pda]] so that they add the data to Wikidata instead of Wikipedia. -[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 13:23, 22 July 2014 (UTC)
*:::The major source of new Persondata templates, in my experience, is the Articles for Creation process, where reviewers are encouraged by the script to fill out a template. This should be fixed before any attempt at removing Persondata is made. [[User:APerson|APerson]]&nbsp;([[User talk:APerson|talk!]]) 02:34, 2 August 2014 (UTC)

*The one question that no one is answering is how Wikidata is being maintained? Another example I have just come across is [[Ed Vokes]]. Someone updated his birth and death dates on Wikipedia two months ago (16 May 2014). Although the editor updated Persondata but Wikidata still shows the old information. [[User:Periglio|Periglio]] ([[User talk:Periglio|talk]]) 17:21, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
*:Have to agree with above comment to which there has been no answer as yet. There are numerous wiki's interfacing into wikidata and there need to be some means of ensuring that they are all kept in step for this to be useful information. Having had experience of the out of date information on wikidata for simple things such as Commons links, there need to be some rigorous system available before we can rely on wikidata information. [[User:Keith D|Keith D]] ([[User talk:Keith D|talk]]) 12:37, 30 July 2014 (UTC)

*Has this RfC actually achieved anything? The anti-persondata lobby argument argument seems to be based on fact that they don't use it, so lets delete it. As someone who has invested time in playing with the birth and death data, I'm worried that Wikidata will actually be maintained. Although not normally visible, from my experience PersonData normally gets updated when someone changes a date. At the moment, there is nothing in place to update Wikidata.
:I would like to use WikiData but I need to convince myself that Wikidata is just as reliable as Persondata. I am working on a Wikidata extract and in the next few days will be generating some meaningful statistics comparing Persondata and Wikidata to see if there is a problem. All I ask is for Persondata to carry on, business as usual, until we have some actual facts in front of us. [[User:Periglio|Periglio]] ([[User talk:Periglio|talk]]) 13:11, 3 August 2014 (UTC)
:: This RFC hasn't achieved anything because we are going to be removing something beneficial for something that has significantly more problems and the fact that AWB and users are actively updating, maintaining and working on a monumental task while a more "meta" problem is still being worked through. If users don't use or need it, they don't have to, but I see no need to remove it when an equal or better alternative does not exist.

:Update: I have done an analysis [[User:Periglio/Wikidata|(link here)]] on over 4000 records comparing Persondata and Wikidata. My first conclusion is that both databases have the same level of coverage, which is around 95% of the total population of notable people. My other conclusion is that Wikidata appears to have the edge on accuracy. The bulk of corrections I am making appear to be updating Persondata to match changes in the Wikipedia article. In short, I am switching my personal project to Wikidata and no longer extracting from Persondata. However, I still remain opposed to the removal of Persondata until SHORT DESCRIPTION is moved across to Wikidata. [[User:Periglio|Periglio]] ([[User talk:Periglio|talk]]) 19:40, 4 August 2014 (UTC)
* {{comment}} separately maintaining {{t|Persondata}} is an anachronism with Wikidata existing. *If* the template is to be retained, then it should be auto-filled from WD. That said there is valid comment that there are many statements in existing person data that is not replicated to WD. So until the point that the data is transferred/merged, then we should be retaining the anachronism.

#'''Support'''. Persondata is a very rarely used feature whose purpose is now replaced by Wikidata. The reliability of Wikidata is as good if not better than persondata (as per Periglio's research) so the reason for its existence is now obsolete. Many of the oppose comments have supporting arguments that are perplexing or based on misunderstandings. The non-reader facing aspect of persondata has always made persondata something of an anomaly and I'll be glad to see it go. The tools that use persondata are few and should be easy enough to modify or block. It would be good if somebody were to run a project to import persondata missing from Wikidata and/or to repair inconsistencies between them but even if that's not done during a pre-removal period, I think removing persondata is a positive step forward. Usually change requires more pain that this will entail so this is a rather easy decision. [[User:Jason Quinn|Jason Quinn]] ([[User talk:Jason Quinn|talk]]) 11:51, 23 August 2014 (UTC)
#'''Support'''. When I first game here, back in 2009 (2010 was my year when I decided to remove Persondata). When I did it to numerous of articles on the English site, someone told me that it is used to collect dumps from other sites. However, I took a look at other language Wikis such as Russian, Ukrainian, etc, and found out that only {{tl|Defaultsort}} is used! When I first saw Wikidata only couple of moths ago, when it was administered to remove interwikis I was amazed that such a small thing can do something as big as that! My main question however is how and when we will implement it, when we don't even have a template for it, or it will be another invisible tool? Either way, I never liked Persondata because it just adds 240 kb to a server which is already suffering few delays (depending on where you live).--[[User:Mishae|Mishae]] ([[User talk:Mishae|talk]]) 02:47, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

=== Oppose (Persondata removal) ===
# '''Oppose''': First of all, the claim that Persondata are ''currently not being used by anybody'' is wrong. Tools that evaluate Persondata [[:de:Hilfe:Personendaten#Arbeiten mit den Personendaten|exist]] and are being used. Secondly, Wikidata cannot be taken seriously at this stage as its data (beyond the interwiki links) are simply not reliable. As elaborated [[:de:Hilfe Diskussion:Personendaten/Archiv/5#Wikidata|in this discussion]], Wikidata looks like a Wikipedia from 2003 without any references. A Wikipedia article, however, combines both, literature and references that backup the data given in the Persondata template. At the current state of affairs, the Wikipedia articles and their Persondata records should be considered as a source, not as a target for Wikidata. --[[User:AFBorchert|AFBorchert]] ([[User talk:AFBorchert|talk]]) 08:32, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
#:And another observation: I just took a first look at one of the [http://dumps.wikimedia.org/wikidatawiki/20140705/ dumps of wikidata]. They are as ugly as hell as they are embedding JSON within XML. To extract person data from Wikipedia dumps is pretty simple (and frequently done). This fun will be all gone when you have to turn to Wikidata dumps. --[[User:AFBorchert|AFBorchert]] ([[User talk:AFBorchert|talk]]) 08:43, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
#::[[User:AFBorchert|AFBorchert]]:
#::Wikidata does not contain enough references, but English Persondata do not contain any, so I do not really understand what your point is. The real question would be which is more reliable between birth/death place/date in Wikidata and in English Persondata. I see no argument one way or the other.
#::German Persondata appear to be more used than the English ones, but the discussion for removing them should be done in Wikipedia in German. Does any German tool use English Persondata ? --[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 09:56, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
#:::{{Ping|Superzoulou}} Persondata are embedded in articles that (hopefully) provide references to backup this data. Hence, you have both, data and references in one place very close to each other. If the article is updated in this regard, the persondata can be easily adapted in one edit. At Wikidata we have mostly a heap of data without any references. This does not help us and is surely no replacement for the current Persondata. I refered to the German discussions as de-wp as this was debated there half a year ago. I think it is always worthwile to look into other similar projects and their discussions. And indeed the Persondata were introduced at de-wp and later imported to en-wp. It is surely a predecessor to Wikidata and at some time it may be envisioned to deprecate it but currently I would see it as a great tool that helps in the transition to Wikidata which is not yet sufficiently mature to replace it in my opinion. --[[User:AFBorchert|AFBorchert]] ([[User talk:AFBorchert|talk]]) 11:54, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
#:::::{{ping|AFBorchert}} English Persondata are mostly meant for bots that are not smart enough to read the rest of the article, and for them references elsewhere in the page are not really useful. It is true that people who maintain the template can check the consistency between Persondata and the rest of the article, but I wonder how many people do it by hands. Bots can also check the consistency of the data between Wikidata and Wikipedia. --[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 13:17, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
#::::::{{ping|Superzoulou}} I do it “by hand” at en-wp as well as de-wp.

# '''Oppose''' (from wikiproject templates): until wikidata is brought online, persondata needs to stay ''in order to populate wikidata'' with the largest source we have of data on article subjects. I know that AWB automatically copies information from infoboxes to persondata, so there is obviously significant overlap on those two, and I am absolutely convinced that persondata's usefulness will soon expire. But we need to keep this on enwiki, up until a bot goes through and copies the persondata entries to wikidata (just like they did with interwiki links), and no later; nobody else has nearly the comprehensive coverage of biographies that would facilitate that transfer.

#::::Please go back and actually read what I wrote.

That's what "we need to keep this... until a bot goes through and copies the persondata to wikidata" means. Since that has not yet happened, I oppose deprecating persondata ''at this time''. There might also be an argument for keeping it supported after that time, if the transfer bot remains in operation, so that it can be used as a backdoor wikidata upload.

#'''Oppose'''. I am just using Persondata to populate some missing birth/death dates in Wikidata; there are ''hundreds of thousands'' of statements that can be used on Wikidata. And if Wikidata were fully "populated", there is no reason to run bots to sync; the template can automatically show Wikidata information if no local data is set, and even add the page to a maintenance category if both is the case, so the information can be merged on Wikidata, and the local data can be removed.

#'''Oppose''' People do use persondata. I am using the data extracted from Persondata on my own website to generate facts eg "Who is 50 years old today". Although my use may be regarded as trivial,it shows that Persondata is available for serious research - births and deaths of over a million notable people. A lot of people are stating that Persondata is not used, but on what evidence? Extraction tools exist, who knows what people do with the article they download?
#:My second reason for opposing is that based on my own experience, Wikidata does not provide a reliable alternative for birth and death dates. Admittedly, there appears to be an editor who updates Wikidata death dates as soon as they happen, but new articles and fixes to old articles do not get onto Wikidata. Someone editing an article would not necessarily think that they need to fix Wikidata as well. 
#:Finally, again from my experience, Persondata is pretty accurate. I expanded my own software to validate the extract, comparing dates against categories for example. There were only two or three thousand entries, from 1.1 million articles, where persondata had vandalised or out of date data and I am currently fixing those!

#:::::{{ping|Periglio}}. At the moment, I do not think this sort of update is done systematically. But again, is it done for Persondata ? If so, it should be possible to update the system so that it updates Wikidata instead. --[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 09:46, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
#::::{{ping|Superzoulou}} Persondata is updated manually, but will normally be seen by editors updating the article. The editor is not necessarily aware of Wikidata so I can see a situation where Wikidata will be out of sync with Wikipedia. This is a general problem for Wikidata. There will be more people actively maintaining accuracy on Wikipedia, and there does not appear to be anything in place to keep Wikidata in sync. [[User:Periglio|Periglio]] ([[User talk:Periglio|talk]]) 15:48, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
#:::::{{ping|Periglio}} Persondata are not very visible either: you need to either edit the very last section, or the whole page and scroll all the way down to the end of the page. I doubt many users do it. With the Visual Editor, it might be even worse. Do we have any data about how many people update Persondata ? Without really looking for it, I just found an article ([[Otto Zdansky]]) with Persondata out of synch with the article's body. For the (few ?) experienced contributors, who update Persondata, I think we could advertise more Wikidata instead. --[[User:Superzoulou|Superzoulou]] ([[User talk:Superzoulou|talk]]) 20:46, 28 July 2014 (UTC)

#'''Oppose''' - Wikidata is not able to adequately run the data and use it in a meaningful way or respond as flexibly as Enwiki users have made it - Wikidata is not equal or better than our current system and is a very technical part of the projects that seems unable to keep pace or integrate efficiently to make Persondata truly obsolete or needlessly redundant, yet. [[User:ChrisGualtieri|ChrisGualtieri]] ([[User talk:ChrisGualtieri|talk]]) 04:46, 4 August 2014 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' - I do not see a legitimate reason for the removal of Persondata. It is assuredly helpful for those who are collecting large amounts of data, and allows a way to index the individuals.

[[User:Jab843|Jab843]] ([[User talk:Jab843|talk]]) 02:50, 5 August 2014 (UTC)
#'''Oppose''' - Persondata is a useful component for editors who wish to add data which would not always be presented in an article (especially if there is no box) including variations in the name (or spelling thereof), additional names (stage names, pen names), exact date of birth and death (rather than just the year), exact geographical locations (including any useful details of village, municipality, region, country) in addition to those specified in the article.

#'''Oppose''' because of Magnus' project, if nothing else; we mustn't delete persondata as redundant when it still has substantial amounts of unique information.  Moreover, Ipigott makes a great point; this is useful for people who are familiar with Wikipedia but not with Wikidata.  Perhaps we could deprecate its addition to articles, saying "If you want to add this type of metadata, please create a Wikidata entry", but not remove it from pages that already have it.

#:This is true, but part of  bigger problem. Although Wikidata largely references Wikipedia for birth and death dates, I am finding that Wikipedia rarely has a date of birth reference.

Basically a lot of people who don't actually know what's going on are saying "get rid of something I don't understand!" How about, no. At least not yet.

#'''Oppose''' - Not only is this premature and unnecessary, it is original research that reached a false conclusion.

Yes it is hidden but I have found that when it is "out of sync with the article", it is, at times, a vandals handiwork that didn't get reverted. The mechanism to keep it in sync is called collaborative editing, and while it is somewhat redundant when an infobox is present, it is not superfluous because of its usefulness to expose the residue of a vandals hoax. The parameters do have a standard format as can be seen at [[Template:Persondata/doc#TemplateData]], and the documentation can be improved by any editor who sees a deficient instruction.—[[User:John Cline|John Cline]] ([[User talk:John Cline|talk]]) 21:44, 26 August 2014 (UTC)

===Wikidata person import faulty===
Whatever process for importing personal data into Wikidata from Wikipedia appears to be faulty. For example, [[Francis Bacon]] says he was born born January 22, 1561, which obviously must be a Julian calendar date, since the Gregorian calendar wasn't created until 1583. But the Wikidata item (Q37388) says his birth date is January 22, 1561, and claims the date was imported from Wikipedia. So who or what is doing this importing and do they have any clue about how calendars work?  [[User:Jc3s5h|Jc3s5h]] ([[User talk:Jc3s5h|talk]]) 20:25, 7 August 2014‎ (UTC)
:I will just add that Francis Bacon is not just a one off incident. My analysis has found the same happening with the Russian calendar and a few where the bot picked up a inaccurate date that was not the date being reference. Another example [[Lekain]] where Wikidata has two dates, which may be Gregorian related. There is a lot of tidying up that needs to be done.

== RfC: Should the hidden navbar be removed from the base Stub and WikiProject banner templates? ==
{{archive top
| Closing per long-standing request at [[WP:ANRFC]].  Other than [[WP:PERF]], there's not a whole lot of official guidance here for decisions like this one.  While it's suggested that removing the template ''might'' improve performance for some editors based on how widely it is used, it's not clear whether this impact would be noticeable.  (It might be helpful to try this out on something like [https://test.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page testwiki] to get some actual data.)  Some editors may find these extra links for fixing purposes as well.  All that said, '''there was no consensus on what to do with the CSS-hidden navbar''' from the specified templates, meaning they should be kept until a more definitive consensus has been formed.

Should the CSS-hidden navbar be removed from the base Stub (1.8 million pages) and WikiProject banner (5.5 million pages) templates? -- [[User:Netoholic|Netoholic]] [[User talk:Netoholic|@]]  19:16, 30 July 2014 (UTC) (re-signing to keep from being archived early -- [[User:Netoholic|Netoholic]] [[User talk:Netoholic|@]]  01:46, 15 August 2014 (UTC))

===Survey===
* '''Remove''' - This {{tl|navbar}} template call was [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WPBannerMeta/core&diff=259375408&oldid=258793115 added to the WikiProject banner] back in 2008, but then [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WPBannerMeta/core&diff=next&oldid=259387592 immediately hidden] by CSS (display:none) in {{tl|WPBannerMeta/core}}.  The same thing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Asbox&diff=313032685&oldid=311729910 exists] in the Stub base template {{tl|Asbox}}. There is a CSS trick which editors can add to their custom CSS files, but this trick hasn't been publicized and is in use by only a handful of already experienced users. Even though it is hidden by CSS, it still adds a few hundred characters to every stubbed or bannered talk page download (and pages with multiple banners add it multiple times). The navbar template transclusion itself is called every time a page is saved (which for talk pages can be alot).  Now, normally, we don't worry about performance, but in the template design space we do have to weigh the costs vs benefits, and since these templates are so widely used, I think every small efficiency we can do deserves consideration. The people that know about this hidden trick or would use it, are also experienced enough to get by without it on the rare occasions they need to edit a particular stub or WikiProject template. -- [[User:Netoholic|Netoholic]] [[User talk:Netoholic|@]]  19:16, 30 July 2014 (UTC)
* '''Keep''' and add the code to view the links to [[MediaWiki:Group-templateeditor.css]]. I'm basing this on the discussions about this I found ([[Template talk:Asbox/Archive 2#Navbar]] & [[Template talk:Asbox/Archive 4#Why the navbar ?]]) which were sufficient enough to convince me it is a good idea to have the links. I'd be happy to brief over other discussions if you care to link them. Also, I'm not sure if you've notified the people involved in the previous discussions (if you even found all of the discussions, which I'm sure I haven't and don't expect you have), a quick {{Ping group|group ping|MSGJ|Xeno|Amalthea|TheDJ|Happy-melon|Topbanana|Grutness|WOSlinker}} should do it. — <span class="nowrap">&#123;&#123;U&#124;[[User:Technical 13|Technical 13]]&#125;&#125; <sup>([[Special:EmailUser/Technical 13|e]] • [[User talk:Technical 13|t]] • [[Special:Contribs/Technical 13|c]])</sup></span> 14:36, 1 August 2014 (UTC)
* '''Neutral'''.   A few facts I can throw at this discussion;  firstly the hidden navbar edit links are [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&profile=advanced&search=%22stub+navbar%22&fulltext=Search&ns2=1&profile=advanced&nsToken=628ff324e6c270df1c3ca700ecf08285%2B\ used by 8 Wikipedians].  Per [[WP:PERF]], we should be prioritising pretty much everything over efficiency;  there is [[Template_talk:Asbox/Archive_4#Why_the_navbar_.3F|some discussion here]] about the impact of this feature - despite the implementation being truly and absolutely awful, it's trivial in the bigger picture of Wikimedia ops.  On balance, if there's a better way to do it, we should.  If not, we keep it as is. - [[User:Topbanana|TB]] ([[User talk:Topbanana|talk]]) 09:48, 2 August 2014 (UTC)

*'''Remove'''. It was never really necessary to have this on stub templates in the first place. As Netoholic points out, if you're editing stub templates, chances are you've got enough nous here to know how to do that without having to resort to the embedded links. Similarly, if you're editing a wikiproject's banner, chances are you know what you're doing. I've added the necessary coding in monobook to be able to use them myself, but I can't remember the last time I've actually edited a template this way - it's only the barest fraction quicker than simply editing direct from the template's page. Having the links there, if anything, encourages people to edit the templates - and while editing article pages should be encourages, making changes to heavily-used templates is beyond the scope of "be bold", since it can have far-reaching consequences. So no real benefit, and potential for trouble = ditch it. [[User:Grutness|Grutness]]...''<small><font color="#008822">[[User_talk:Grutness|wha?]]</font></small>'' 11:34, 2 August 2014 (UTC)
*'''Comment''' - I don't know enough about this template and its uses to opine about it specifically, but I would like to make a general comment.  [[WP:PERF]] tells regular editors not to worry about performance because it's beyond their ability to do much about it, since their permissions have been deliberately limited to prevent project-wide impact. While it's true that the "IT professionals" or others with special permissions may be needed to make changes such as the one being discussed, they rely on us to decided which features are important.  More and more readers are viewing Wikipedia pages on mobile devices, and I've been reading a lot of comments from editors about page load times on these devices.  If a template is being called a gazillion times and is rarely used, I think that efficiency ''should'' be considered as well as utility.  &mdash;[[User:Anne Delong|Anne Delong]] ([[User talk:Anne Delong|talk]]) 10:31, 7 August 2014 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' When stub templates and WikiProject banners break page layout, or put pages in incorrect categories, which they sometimes do when somebody (either with good or bad intentions) has been playing with the markup, these links make it much quicker to go straight in and fix. {{replyto|Topbanana}} - I only just noticed this (I came looking for [[#Adding a link to "authors" in Wikipedia's by-line|this thread]], and searched for my own name to see if I'd already commented), please note that {{diff|Wikipedia:Village pump (proposals)|prev|619784971|this attempt to ping failed}} because you didn't sign it at the same time.

== Commons admins with viewdelete ==

Some time back, there was a proposal to give Commons admins the right to view deleted content across all WMF wikis; I can't find it, or I'd link it.  It gained broad support, but WMF vetoed it on technical grounds, as (if I remember rightly) it wasn't possible to get the software to grant rights to a user on one wiki just because the same user had been granted a different set of rights on another wiki.  As far as I remember, WMF wasn't objecting to the idea; I got the impression that it would have been accepted had it been possible to implement.

With this in mind, I wonder what people would think about a request to developers for a new userright that admins here could grant: the right would be called "Commons admin", with just the ability to view deleted revisions of files (both the log entries from the history page, and the actual contents of text revisions and uploads), i.e. vaguely comparable to [[WP:Researcher]] in that viewing is the only additional ability, but more viewing ability than Researcher in filespace and no viewing ability in all other namespaces.  Upon creation of this userright, we would grant it to any Commons admin who requested it, but under no circumstances would it be granted to anyone else, and (aside from gross abuse) the only reason for removing it would be that the user was no longer a Commons admin.  As the biggest WMF project, we're probably the biggest source of images that get transwikied to Commons, so if creating this userright is practical, we'd be able to resolve a big portion of the difficulty that prompted the proposal.  I understand that we currently don't have any admin-grantable userrights that involve deletion, basically because admin-type rights are typically granted only after a substantial community discussion, but this is different: we'd simply be allowing our admins to implement what our software would do if it were possible, and anyway people don't become admins at Commons without a substantial community discussion.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 14:58, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
* As long as Foundation Legal is ok with it. (there are legal reasons why view deleted needs to be restricted to a limit number of people, but past discussions haven't given much guidance on how limited, a handful of commons admins who request it should probably be fine) I don't see any reason not to do it. That said, I've very rarely come across requests for that sort of info, do commons admins need it often?

* I would personally not have any objections, on the other hand, I am a Commons admin, and I needed this right only a couple of times in my life. Those who transfer a lot of files or those who are superactive on FFD may need the right more often.--[[User:Ymblanter|Ymblanter]] ([[User talk:Ymblanter|talk]]) 16:53, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
**Monty, I suspect that this wouldn't be a Legal concern, since Commons admins already have viewdeleted over there; my proposal, if successful, wouldn't expand the number of trusted users WMF-wide.  Both of you address the "how many people" issue, so I've left an announcement at [[:Commons:COM:AN]] — hopefully we'll hear from more Commons admins.

*Sounds like a good idea. Having done almost 170000 deletions and 1400 undeletions on Commons, there've been plenty of times when I could have used this to determine whether to restore/delete/DR an image, but instead had to wait for an en.wiki admin to check a file and reply back with the needed info (except for the 6 months when I was an en.wiki admin myself of course). There aren't many admins regularly involved in deletions/undeletions/DR/CSD at Commons, so the right would only likely be given to a small number of Commons admins.

:*Please re-read the proposal.  I'm proposing a technical workaround for manual implementation of the 2008 proposal, since it can't be implemented automatically.  I'm suggesting the creation of just a local userrights group, which shouldn't be too hard; during discussions related to [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Template editor user right]] (I can't find the precise spot), someone observed that creating the TE userright wouldn't be that difficult for the developers.  Should all aspects of my proposal be implemented, we admins will be able to grant it just as easily as we grant rollback, although of course relevant policy will place much greater restrictions on who gets it; requests from "hat collectors" will automatically be declined.  [[User:Nyttend|Nyttend]] ([[User talk:Nyttend|talk]]) 13:47, 20 August 2014 (UTC)
::*Umm, how does that work around the technical problems exactly? We'd still need to create a "viewdeletedfile" to add to the enwp group, and at that point we might as well just put it in a global group. [[User:Legoktm|Legoktm]] ([[User talk:Legoktm|talk]]) 17:37, 21 August 2014 (UTC)
:::*As I understand it, in 2008, the idea was as follows.  Legoktm is an ordinary Commons user and Wikipedian without admin rights, so he can't see anything that's been deleted on any projects.  He passes the Commons equivalent to RFA, and with a single click of the button by a Commons bureaucrat, he's able to view all deleted revisions in the file namespace of all WMF projects; here at en:wp, he can't delete or undelete anything, and he can't view deleted content in mainspace or portalspace, but he can view deleted revisions of files.  Such an idea was rejected by WMF, and if I understand rightly, the idea was simply that it couldn't be done — the ru.wikibooks and ang.wikisource servers have no way to understand changes to your userrights on Commons.  My proposal is basically a manual workaround, since a human can look at your Commons rights log and make relevant modifications to your rights on other wikis.  I know absolutely nothing about global rights, so I can't make any solid comments.  Are you basically suggesting that this be a steward-grantable thing, with the provision that when a steward hits a button on Meta, you immediately can view all deleted revisions in the file namespace of all WMF projects?  If that's what you mean, I would say that it was even better than my proposal, but again I have no idea whether things work that way.

* Quid pro quo, if we do this, Commons should be willing to grant the same right to en admins at Commons on request.  We sometimes need to investigate the disappearance of an image from a Wikipedia article, and that is made ten times more difficult if it was deleted on Commons.

* Granting the ability to view deleted '''files''' on a case by case basis to commons admins (or an editor here who just wants to work on file stuff, I guess) is a good idea.

:As I noted above, researcher is different: it covers all namespaces, but it provides far less information about deleted pages than admins are able to get.

== OTRS members ==

Following a misunderstanding on my part about an editor modifying an {{tl|OTRS permission}} template on a file page, I propose that a new user group be created for [[WP:OTRS|OTRS members]] similar to the one on [[:c:Commons:User access levels#OTRS members|Commons]] so that such editors can be clearly identified. Personally I've grown used to hovering my mouse pointer over an editor's name and seeing a pop-up box that contains basic details including the user groups that editor is a member of. In this instance I saw only the word "rollbacker" and forgetting to check the actual userpage, I asked a question at the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:OTRS_noticeboard&diff=623377338&oldid=623198585 OTRS noticeboard] about whether the license for a particular file was correct because it had been added by someone I thought wasn't an OTRS member. I'm sure I'm not alone in having this bad habit of using pop-ups rather than clicking on a page and checking it more thoroughly, but it occurs to me that we should have a separate user group for these editors because they are a trusted group and they have access to classified information. If it avoids another embarrassing episode on my part, I think it will be worthwhile to have this group.

Then, create an edit summary to pick up any addition of {{tl|permissionOTRS}} or {{tl|ConfirmationOTRS}} by users not in the groups (like [[:c:Special:AbuseFilter/69|this one]]).

== Adding non-economical ranks to the table at the top of country articles ==

I'm perhaps a bit of idealist, but find it odd that only economical ranks (GDP, Gini) or ranks based mostly on economic performance (HDI) are shown at the {{t|Infobox country}} table. I suggest adding information about state of democracy, state of freedom of speech and level of corruption the the table, right below the GDP, HDI and Gini ranks. These give a much wider view to the society than just economical. 

Especially prosperous East Asian countries seem to be like Western countries based on the table and the introduction part in the article, but they have significantly lower political freedoms than their Western counterparts and are often more corrupt. The table in the article Singapore according to my proposion would look like this: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/27lwtk47dnorsqw/Country%20infobox%20proposal.png?dl=0] Giving the three ranks of [[Democracy Index]], [[Press Freedom Index]] and [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] would help understanding the Singaporean exceptionalism, where the 3rd highest GDP and the 5th best rank in the Corruption Index is combined with an authoritarian regime, the Press Freedom being lower than in Russia. <span class="font face:arial">/[[User:á|á]]<sup>([[User talk:á|!]])</sup></span> 00:48, 1 September 2014 (UTC)
:The problem is that those other indexes are incredibly subjective. Even when it comes to a concept such as freedom, different people can consider the same factor as adding to, or detracting from freedom. Is a society that protects your religious beliefs from criticism more free as a result, or less free because to do so infringes on the freedom of someone who would criticize your beliefs? Do we measure freedom as negative rights against government, do we include positive rights, what about "rights" that restrict what other individuals or associations can do?

::I agree that general most free countries indexes are quite subjective, but these three indexes are subjective only to some level. In the Press Freedom and Corrption indexes information is gathered from many sources – from 13 sources in the Corruption Index –, and in the Democracy Index, the criteria are openly shown at their website, and the criteria are measuring solely level of democracy, not things like religious freedom. If the elections are not plagued by fraud and oppression of voters and the opposition is not harrassed, then the country is more democratic. 
::If you compare the Democracy Indexes made by Economist Intelligence Unit and World Audit, they look very similar. EIU ranks Singapore as #81 and World Audit as #71. EIU ranks Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and New Zeeland as the most democratic countries, while World Audit ranks Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and New Zeeland as most democratic countries. There are similar small differences between GDP ranks. IMF ranks Qatar, Luxembourg and Singapore as the wealthiest countries, the top 3 of World Bank rank is Qatar, Luxembourg and Kuwait, and CIA ranks Qatar, Liechtenstein and Monaco as the top 3. 
::On the other hand, if you look at the page [[List of countries by income equality]], the amount money the richest 20% gets compared to how much money the poorest 20% gets gives a different list than the list of countries with lowest Gini. The 20/20 ratio gives Japan, Czech Republic and Finland as the countries with least income equality, while Denmark, Sweden and Norway have the lowest Gini coefficients.

== New user status level/new protection level ==

Is there any way that a semblance of common sense could be applied to the current designations of user status, and, relatedly, to how article protection is done?

Currently we have "autoconfirmed users". To be "autoconfirmed" on English Wikipedia you have to have been registered for 4 days and made at least 10 edits [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_access_levels#Autoconfirmed_users]. '''Ten freakin' edits'''. How long does it take you to make ten edits? I can make ten edits in under five seconds (I am 100% certain that most users can beat that time easily). I really really hope that this is some archaic throwback to the early days of Wikipedia, like 2002, when very few people edited the encyclopedia, and did so rarely, so back then this low threshold made some sense. Otherwise it's just some supreme nonsense. We are not in 2002 anymore and this requirement is completely superfluous.

So here's proposal #1, the '''Minimal proposal''': Drop the "10 edits" requirement from what it takes to be autoconfirmed. This is just common sense which shouldn't even have to be explained and doing so will have no real effect on editors what so ever. It's just recognizing that... it's not 2002 anymore.

But obviously, having an edit requirement is actually a good thing, which is why this now-ridiculous threshold of 10 edits was put in there in the first place. It's just that now, the threshold should be much higher. And in fact, other language Wikipedias do set a much higher level (usually these are the ones with some kind of flagged revisions). So how about getting realistic and setting the auto-confirmed standard at at least 300 hundred edits. Even that is ridiculously low. If it takes me less than 5 seconds to make 10 edits, it will take me less than two minutes to make 300 edits. Any person who wishes to cause trouble around these parts has only to exert minimal effort to meet that (proposed, higher) standard. Really, the threshold should be at 1000 or more edits. But I understand there's institutional inertia here and all that, so... baby steps.

Second, under the generous assumption that it's recognized that the current system of "autoconfirmed users" is just plain idiotic, we need to revisit article protection. Right now we have either semi-protection or full-protection. These are about the two worst options that could be implemented.

Under semi-protection, disruptive users just have to wait four days, go to effort of making ten edits, and then they're free to go. Of course, somewhat smarter disruptive users, will start an account, make ten edits and then just let it sit there for a year or two, then utilize them again when the real edit warring/disruptive activity needs to be done. Anyone who's been involved in content writing or even content supervision knows very well that this is a very common phenomenon (throw away sleeper accounts) across the encyclopedia. Hence, semi-protection doesn't do crap. It's really "nothing".

At the other extreme we have full-protection. Here, only admins are allowed to edit articles, and any proposed changes by non-admins need to be floated on the talk page first. Under ideal circumstances this would work IF: 1) admins who full-protect pages actually bothered to keep track of these pages and, again relateldy, 2) the admin corps was skilled in content-related edits. We can AGF the first part, but it's clear as day that most admins do not become admins because they are familiar with content editing. There's actually nothing wrong with that. Different people have different skills, some people are good at writing content and others are good at administrative work. The problem is that "full protection" forces the people who are mainly good at administrative work to engage in the content work which they are completely not suited for. So mostly... they don't do it.

The end result of this - the combination of the fact that troll-ish new accounts can easily bypass the joke that is "semi-protection" and the frustration with being unable to edit a page which is "fully-protected" by non-admin but established users is that '''serious editors are leaving Wikipedia'''. More and more, which is something we're all aware of.

What we need is an intermediate level of protection and a new level of status, which is higher than the presently silly "autoconfirmed" user one, but not "admin". 

So here is '''proposal #2''': establish a status which requires 1 year on Wikipedia, 1000 edits and a minimum threshold of these in article space. Establish a protection level which allows these users but not the "I made 10 edits four days ago, now I get to vandalize Wikipedia articles all I want" ones edit.

*I think what you are talking about is fundamentally a "vested contributor" status. While I don't really have a fully fleshed out opinion on this proposal, the one unintended consequence I think this may overlook is that, right now, full protection is actually quite rare an occurrence, and tends to get withdrawn very quickly, largely because it is so onerous for admins to maintain. The low bar to autoconfirmed status means that by default, en.wikipedia is about as strikingly close to the ideal of "the encyclopedia anyone can edit" as can be done feasibly. I think that any conversation about implementing a new "highly protected" status would need to address the possibility of disturbing that equilibrium that so effectively encourages open editing on en.wikipedia in practice as well as in theory. [[User:Vanisaac|Van]][[User talk:Vanisaac|Isaac]]<sub><small>[[WP:WikiProject Writing systems|WS]]</small></sub><sup style="margin-left:-3.0ex">[[Special:Contributions/Vanisaac|cont]]</sup> 02:07, 31 August 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks for the input. A couple of points. 
::First, overall, given that Wikipedia has more than 4.5 million articles I'm sure that full protection is indeed rare. However, if we limit the scope to critical, or highly viewed, or controversial articles - or some combination of these - the situation is different. On these, it's frequent enough to be a hindrance or at least an annoyance.
::Second, you're also right in that full protection tends to get withdrawn very quickly. But that's a symptom of its dysfunctionality rather than a perk. Basically what happens is that an important article suffers disruption, it gets fully protected, serious editors then cannot edit the article and get extremely annoyed so then they bug and harangue the admin who fully protected it, so then after some back and forth (and some potential and unnecessary drama, even AN/I discussions) it gets lifted. The fact that full protection is "quickly withdrawn" is evidence of the fact that it sucks and that it doesn't work. Not a testament to its viability.
::And you're also right about the third issue - the lowbar to autoconfirmed status does mean that pretty much "anyone can edit". Ok, having admitted that, we can go two ways. One: if it doesn't mean anything why even bother with it? Why even have "autoconfirmed status"? If we really want "everyone to edit" why bother with the hypocrisy of this label and why even semi-protect articles? (A more honest approach would be to simply ban unregistered IPs from editing certain articles). Two: despite the high falutin' rhetoric, we actually DON'T want "anyone" to edit the encyclopedia. We ban people all the time. We waste tremendous amounts of time reverting vandalism. And disruptive edits. And sock puppets of banned users. And sock puppets of vandals. And sock puppets of banned vandals. Etc. We obviously WANT a certain threshold of edit quality to exist and if somebody cannot meet that they're not part of that "anyone" that can edit. That "ideal" that you mention is a "founding myth" which was actually never true in the first place (even back in 2002 they blocked people). It's time we grow up and admit to ourselves that certain standards are necessary (we even have essays, like [[WP:COMPETENCE]] or [[WP:NOTHERE]]) which pretty much say it).
::Finally, and this is in some ways fundamental, the problem is that this is NOT an "equilibrium". An "equilibrium" implies a state of stasis, a constant, a situation which can be expected to persist for the foreseeable future. This isn't it. We're loosing editors, and what's worse, we're loosing *quality* editors. And a lot of that has to do with the issues outlined above. I'd elaborate on this point but we'd be getting off topic. What we have now is an *outcome*, not an *equilibrium*. A bad outcome too, and more importantly an unsustainable one.

* A valuable proposal. This could lead to a desirable simplification of the user rights system: we could create a general "trusted editor" status, amalgamating:
:* rollbacker
:* reviewer (i.e. can approve or reject pending changes)
:* autoreviewer (i.e. own new pages not patrolled)
:* can edit semi-protected pages
:* more controversially - can delete pages.
:The pending-changes system would then be abolished as identical in effect with semi-protection.<br>Approval for the trusted-editor right would be by (1) a certain number of edits, (2) a certain time since account opened, (3) in-depth examination of editor's record by an admin (two admins?); and the right could be withdrawn by any admin with reasons given to the editor[[User:Noyster|: <font color="seagreen">'''Noyster'''</font>]] [[User talk:Noyster|<font color="seagreen"> (talk)</font>, ]] 10:00, 31 August 2014 (UTC)

::I actually really like this proposal in concert with a "high protection" level; it both simplifies the current cadre of advanced user rights (reviewer? rollbacker? autoreviewed?) and provides a means of relaxing the overkill of many long-term fully protected pages. As to your concern about viewing deleted material, Mdann, I guess the fundamental question here is whether there is a reason why the ability to delete pages needs to be bundled with the ability to view deleted content. If these were, in fact, decoupled from each other, what would be the obstacles, both technical and practical? As far as I can see, the biggest hassle would be the creation of Criteria for Speedy Undeletion to complement the current [[WP:CSD]], perhaps as a subsection of that policy, for cases when material is accidentally deleted by someone who is unable to undelete (undeletion is fundamentally an ability to view deleted content). It would also introduce a small deletionist bias in the system, so it would need a pretty extensive review process. I certainly think it's an idea worth exploring in more depth.

*Marek, you can make ten edits, I can make ten edits, everyone here can make ten edits, in maybe a minute. A newcomer who is barely grasping wikimarkup can't. More importantly, no, there's no indication that new vandals are anything to do with why people are leaving Wikipedia. Long-term contributors actually have a remarkably high retention rate - it's the newcomers who are struggling - and blocks for vandalism or disruptive behaviour have been going down continuously, in absolute terms, since 2009. [[User:Ironholds|Ironholds]] ([[User talk:Ironholds|talk]]) 15:21, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

The 10 edits are nothing, but the 4 days are significant. I was an admin prior to semi-protection and auto-confirmed. It sucked.

Those 4 days make a huge difference. Yes it is easy to wait 4 days but it takes 10 seconds to block someone. Since semi-protection and autoconfirm came in it has gone from very difficult to very easy to stay on top of socks.

Even if the person makes 20 sleeper accounts it is still easy to revert/block/ignore in minutes and they still need 4 days to make more.

I think the threshold needs to be kept low in order to encourage new users. Even a brief delay is enough for most socks to get bored and move on while giving admins a lopsided advantage over them.

*'''Oppose''' any changes mostly per Chillum, but also because we shouldn't make fundamental changes to how Wikipedia operates and it's philosophy merely because of vandals.  The low threshold allows good faith editors easy access to all of Wikipedia with a minimal effort, and balances that with enough of a restriction to avoid the throw-away accounts Chillum notes.  While certainly annoying, these persistently socking vandal is less of a problem, in terms of volume of people, than are the newbies who want to contribute in good faith.  We should be doing everything we can for the second group.  The first will always be with us, and isn't worth alienating the newbies to institute such a drastic change. --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 02:38, 3 September 2014 (UTC)

*Comment: The 1000 edit criteria is a crude way to compensate for the fact that it's possible to deliberately spam worthless edits. For a good editor who spends time on good edits, 1000 is a pretty substantial bar to pass. What's really needed (if something like this is done) is some criteria that isn't as trivially easily gamed as simple edit count.

**Reply comment: Every single admin knows the tell-tale signs of a vandal account eating through their first ten edits, as do most non-admin vandalism patrollers.  Without delving into [[WP:BEANS]]-type stuff here, it's really obvious when we see this, and not hard to identify.  The 1000-edit count doesn't help us stop bad-faith accounts (of which account for a tiny fraction of all new accounts created at Wikipedia anyways), as much as it does to discourage new users from becoming full contributors.  A balance needs to be struck, and 1000 edits is WAY too much in terms of harming new user participation, against the small benefit of stopping a few vandals.  Even if it stopped a lot of vandals, we do fine enough doing that using traditional means (AIV, etc.)  Contrary to popular belief, we're not being overwhelmed, the system keeps up and squashes most vandals within minutes, and those of us that have been here for many years aren't even annoyed by them anymore.  This is using a shotgun to do a flyswatters job, and has too much collateral damage to be useful. --[[User:Jayron32|<font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font>]]'''''[[User talk:Jayron32|<font style="color:#009900">32</font>]]''''' 23:44, 3 September 2014 (UTC)

== Silent looping autoplay video ==

Animated GIF really sucks. Everyone knows it. It has limited colour depth and inefficient encoding, meaning large file sizes. Surely it can't be the future of a media-rich internet?

What do you think of the idea of allowing silent autoplay looping WebM/Theora video, as a replacement for animated GIF? An example use case would be [[:File:Lunar libration with phase Oct 2007 450px.gif]] which is currently on [[Moon]].

== Extra button to view history ==
Dear all, 

I would like to propose adding an extra button to the top of the page when viewing a history. For example [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steward_requests/Global_permissions&oldid=2898155 this request page]. On the top there are 3 links: "Older revision, Latest revision, Newer revision". However, if you want to know what happened to a request on that page, using the older/newer revision buttons is too slow, moving 1 step at a time, when 100 edits might be in between the request and the answer. You can go to the history section and start going back, but this means searching, and on larger pages it takes some time. I suggest adding an extra button that immediately sends you to the "history section" of that edit, so you are directly at the right spot in the history tab, and can see the 50 edits directly around the edit. 

This same request was made to wikimedia-tech on Bugzilla 7 years ago, see [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9578]. They stated "This would probably not be very hard to implement", however up to date nothing has been done. I am not a Bugzilla user or developer, yet I think this change is usefull and I think we should have it. It gives no disadvantages. I think the only way to get this change is to get some attention for it. I have posted '''[[:meta:Tech#Extra button when viewing history|a request on meta]]''' ( that can be edited by all, unlike bugzilla) and suggest that people reply there to state their opinion on the change. Thank you very much, 

Sincerely, [[User:Taketa|Taketa]] ([[User talk:Taketa|talk]]) 10:15, 2 September 2014 (UTC)

When I compare versions of articles (in the History mode), after marking the two versions to be compared, I have to scroll to the top or bottom of the list of changes.

:{{replyto|Kdammers}} If the history is very long (up to 5000 revisions may be listed simultaneously), and you're comparing two revisions a long way apart (I once compared two revisions about seven years apart in time, about 200 revs in distance), you may still need to scroll some distance to get to that spot in the sidebar. But there is an alternative: hover the mouse over the {{button|{{int:compareselectedversions}}}} button and you should see a tooltip like {{color box|#ffffe1|{{int:tooltip-compareselectedversions}} [...]}} That last part, which I've shown as "[...]", is the [[WP:KB|access key sequence]] that moves focus to the button for your OS/browser combination; you then need to press either the Enter key or the space bar to action the button. For example, I see "[Alt+Shift+{{int:accesskey-compareselectedversions}}]", because I use Firefox under Windows. So, select the two revisions that you wish to compare, and go for {{keypress|Alt|Shift|{{uc:{{int:accesskey-compareselectedversions}}}}}} or equivalent, then {{keypress|Enter}}. --[[User:Redrose64|<span style="color:#a80000; background:#ffeeee; text-decoration:inherit">Red</span>rose64]] ([[User talk:Redrose64|talk]]) 09:44, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

== Option to not break watchlist by day ==

* '''Support''' I would also like to see this. I tend to check multiple days worths of edits at a time on the articles on my watch list. The break down by days just adds a bunch of extra clicks I have to do to find all the changes since I last looked at the article. In particular the behavior of the preference "Expand watchlist to show all changes, not just the most recent" is less than ideal when a page has changes covering multiple days. I really would like a single click from my watch list to the diff of a page between the last time I checked it out to the current version.

:::I'm in the same situation as Gaijin42 and PaleAqua: I can see several days in my watchlist but they're grouped by day. The "n changes" link for a busy article that appears in yesterday's group and today's group too only shows that day's changes.

* '''Support'''. {{Ping|Redrose64}} I think the relevant settings are "{{int:tog-usenewrc}}" and "{{int:tog-extendwatchlist}}". With those two activated, the watchlist basically contains, for each page, the part of that page's history within the given day. However, when there are unvisited changes from several days (which could be as trivial as last night before and after midnight), the history snippet for each page is not in one place, but there is one snippet for each day. In principle there are two possible solutions to this: a) get rid of the grouping by day entirely; b) keep the section headings, but show all changes to a certain page in a single expandable list positioned at the day and time of the last change. In both cases the disadvantage would be that we need to indicate not only the time, but also the date for each individual change. But I think that's a price worth paying for having all changes to a page in a single list, so this would be nice to have at least as an option (that is, user preference).
: Regarding {{tq|a single click from my watch list to the diff of a page between the last time I checked it out to the current version}}, that is not exactly the same: with or without grouping by day, such a link is available if and only if the last ''visited'' change to a page is within the chosen time span of the watchlist. In this case the "cur" link of the last visited change has the described (and very useful) function. It would be nice if such a direct link would be available even if the last visited change is not within the selected time span. For example, the link "xx since last visit" could refer to "all unvisited changes", rather than "all unvisited changes within the time span of the watch list" or currently "all unvisited changes on that day". &mdash;&thinsp;[[User:Hhhippo|<font color="darkblue" face="times">'''H<small>HHIPPO</small>'''</font>]] 22:01, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

:*This is a good example of fair use.  They're taking large amounts of content, but that's because they need to: while they're on the "expression" side of the [[idea-expression divide]], they're only concerned with the expression, and the whole process depends on the precise text itself.  Look at the fair-use test: (1) Purpose and character — they're definitely not competing with copyright holders, and it's quite obviously transformative.  The fact that it's used to detect infringement will probably play into this as well.  (2) Nature of the copyrighted work — not particularly relevant, aside from the fact that they're only working with stuff that's already been published.  (3) Amount and substantiality — they take lots, but in this case, it's definitely true that "the secondary user only copies as much as is necessary for his or her intended use".  (4) Effect upon work's value — nobody's going to use Turnitin as a substitute for a copyrighted work, and as it's used to find infringements, it's quite clearly having a positive effect upon a work's value.

An example of what this could look like is on the article on [[heart failure]]. If there is support for this proposal the word "authors" and link to the list of authors would go within the line of code that creates "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia".

When a person clicks on the word author it takes you to X! tool here [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/articleinfo/?wikilang=en&wikifam=.wikipedia.org&grouped=on&page=Heart_failure]. Preferably the heading "top editors" would be changed to "authors" and that section would be moved up to below "general statistics".

===Discussion (Adding author link) ===
There is a common misunderstanding regarding who writes Wikipedia. All we state now in the byline is that the text is "From Wikipedia". Adding the word authors and having this word link to a list of authors would increase transparency to our readership. 

Another potential benefit is that making it clear that Wikipedia is written by people, people likely very much like the person reading the article in question. It may thus increase people's willingness to edit and this could be easily studied.

Yes I do realize that one can find this information other ways. One can click on the "history" tab. Than click on "revision history statistics" but that does not clearly lead people to whom the authors of the text are. The word history does not lead me to think of authors or editors.

*'''Oppose'''. Not because of the history tab - I'm actually a really big fan of increasing the prominence of the fact that ''did you know you can edit and this was made by people just like you'' because however much we assume we're good at that, we actually do a surprisingly poor job. But the current implementation seems likely to interfere with readership - we're directing people to a potentially-unstable labs tool that forces them to navigate away from Wikipedia and all of its links to other knowledge and other content. We are a project dedicated to knowledge and the interconnectedness of all things, and this setup sends users to a dead end. I'd be really supportive of, say, an experiment to gauge the impact of including a link that pointed at...I don't know. A quick summary of how WP is written by random joes and can be edited by you, too. But it would have to be an actual experiment. This looks likely to do unexpected things to readership that we can't currently track, and produce (potential) positive results we have no way of measuring.

::::I can not support ANYTHING which used number of edits as a measure of excellence, per my comments above.  And number of bytes is no better as a measurement, per the same criteria.  For instance, some of us actually improve the encyclopedia by removing many, many bytes of badly written prose, comments, narratives, editorializing....etc.; the list is almost endless.  Both proposed parameters are pretty much meaningless in the encyclopedia, and wholly not tenable as a measure of article improvement for the reasons I stated.  And I have to ask, just what is gained by allowing the average reader, here for information only, to have an instant link to (for example) the list of the last five "contributors" (or prolific serial vandals who have targeted the article)?  If Wikipedia were trying to be a primary informational source, I would understand and support this; however, Wikipedia is a tertiary information source—we report what others have written—we just do it in our own words.  Authorship is meaningless here (except for those that would revel in their ''article / edit / byte counts'').  Given the stated purpose of Wikipedia, this proposal makes no sense.

:::::They may not be perfect but they are far from meaningless. These are not measures of excellence but measures of contributions. Many of our articles are far from excellent and still have contributors / authors. It also gives the time line for contributions.

:'''Strong Support''' (of the "wtf didn't we do this year's ago?" type). It is just so sensible! Over the years I've been involved with WP you wouldn't believe how often readers / press don't understand where the content comes from or what the history tab signifies. There has been a continuous problem with proper attribution of our content for so long and this is a simple and neat way to do something about that.

'''Strong support''' I delete a lot of text, and I am not entitled to copyright for that, so I won't rank highly for number of bytes (nor edit count) Yet I am delighted that those who do contribute prose and images will get clear credit from this. A 'Contributors' link has plenty of meaning and value to anyone who reads the written word (as does the analogous 'credits' when we enjoy TV, movies and podcasts), and even more meaning to those who actually contribute. It will never be perfect. If we copy and paste a sentence from another Wikipedia article, or from another free source with a compatible license, that won't be automatically attributed. Neither will text from the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica. (For those reasons, I think the current proposal of 'Contributors' is far better than the original 'Authors'.) Yet despite some small weaknesses, which I are largely fixable later, this is a fantastic idea that is far more digestible than the remote possibility that a reader follows 'More/View history' and realizes that tells them not only what was written, but by whom. Is this really the first time in our history that this has been proposed? By the way, the edit count tools have been around for 6 or 7 years, so I don't consider them to be experimental or unstable.

*'''Oppose'''. I just stumbled across this on some medical pages, and at first I thought it was some kind of bugzilla thing. Personally, I hate the idea of placing the link so prominently, because this is supposed to be about the content, not the editors. Readers already know that it's "the encyclopedia that anyone can edit", so they can figure out that those "anyones" must be some people. It's not rocket science. As for giving credit to ''which'' editors it was on a given page, if I wanted credit, I wouldn't be calling myself Tryptofish. And I have a big objection to the way it has been implemented, by tying it into some infoboxes, so it appears on some pages and not others. Either there is widespread consensus to have it all across the English Wikipedia, or it shouldn't be plopped out on an ''ad hoc'' basis.

===Scope===
I've sat back and commented mostly from a technical point of view, but think there is are some components of this discussion that should be directly addressed: 
:'''Should non-content features such as this be consistent across all articles?''' My inclination is that yes they should, and "consensus" driving for this type of change should be project wide on these non-content components of pages.  A discussion on [[WT:MED]] determined that there was consensus to make these types of changes, but only to articles that those project members were looking at.  This can open the door for a lot of scope creep, if every project team rolls out their own layout changes, especially as many articles overlap multiple projects.  Not to wander too far down the slipper slope, but where would this project-specific page layout decision making process end?  Should all non-content components of articles be consistent is a question that deserves some more discussion. — [[User:Xaosflux|<span style="color:#FF9933; font-weight:bold; font-family:monotype;">xaosflux</span>]] <sup>[[User talk:Xaosflux|<span style="color:#00FF00;">Talk</span>]]</sup> 14:49, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

From the below comment by [[User:NinjaRobotPirate|NinjaRobotPirate]], if this is really an issue, pouring a bucket of water over your head while editing Wikipedia may help raise awareness (although from what I've read over the past few months, awareness is already pretty high, and I'm not even in the US.....) --[[User:Mdann52|<span style="color:Green">'''Mdann'''</span>]][[Special:Contributions/Mdann52|<span style="color:Red">'''52'''</span>]]<small>[[User talk:Mdann52|<span style="color:Maroon">''talk to me!''</span>]]</small> 17:50, 9 September 2014 (UTC)}}
There is a movement called 'Go-Slow Day' where websites will show slow loading icons to symbolically show what a slow lane, non net neutral world could look like in a protest against proposals by the FCC for paid prioritization, to show them what kind of negative impact can come from their decision. Larger tech companies are already joining in, and more can be found here on reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2fg8ky/large_us_tech_firms_plan_go_slow_day_in_protest/ If Wikipedia joined in that would be amazing. It is one of the largest sites in the world, and many would follow in their footsteps.

*'''Oppose''' I'm glad we did act on SOPA, and I do think Net Neutrality is important, but I oppose this one. Wikipedia should not (and doesn't) frivolously jump up on every soapbox that we like, but Wikipedia can and will do so if there is extraordinary cause for it.

*'''Big support'''. Net Neutrality MUST be maintained. A non-neutral Internet would destroy the Internet as we currently know it. It would have direct ramifications on people's access to free information. It would allow a few mega corporations to control what people see, hear, and read. It would have direct ramifications for Wikipedia and its readers and editors. With a non-neutral Internet, things like a monthly Wikipedia usage charge could start appearing on your bill from your service provider. Anybody who thinks this is "not our fight" or that Wikipedia shouldn't be making political statements doesn't understand the battle and doesn't see the big picture. Also note that "Slow Down Day" isn't going to literally slow down websites as OP said. It just going to have a "loading" graphic that would help people understand what a non-neutral Internet might be like.

** This particular issue (an [[FCC]] decision) only seems to affect some users of Wikipedia (namely, those who are located in the United States). Would you support a similar campaign if it were about something in some other country (say, [[wmf:Wikipedia Zero|Wikipedia Zero]], which prevents net neutrality in Russia, India and [[wmf:Mobile partnerships|several other countries]])?

***If the system administrators can target US-based IP addresses, then that would be fine. As for the other countries question, it depends whether raising awareness makes sense. However, we must be careful not to trivialize the unique position of the United States in regards to the Internet. What an arbitrary country does with there Internet isn't in the same league as what the United States does. People must realize that a non-free Internet in the US will affect non-American Internet users and non-English speakers. As such, I wouldn't be opposed to raising awareness world-wide. Plus if the US goes non-free, you can bet your bottom dollar that many other countries will follow. I am flexible on the world-wide awareness idea but the Wikipedia absolutely ought to raise ''some'' awareness. Targeting US-based IP addresses would be an appropriate step for the WMF to do.

*****If you are going to call something a "terrible, terrible idea", why don't you actually try to articulate why it is such a terrible idea? You've contributed nothing to the discussion except to say that you don't think Wikipedia should be used for "political pressure tactics", a myopic idea that could ultimately be self-harming to Wikipedia. Does it include all "political" legislation like SOPA? The Village Pump is for discussion of ideas. Opinion quips without detailed reasoning are often noise.

******I responded earlier supporting {{u|Ykraps}}' opinion. I also agree with many of the other reasons given for why it's a terrible idea - Wikipedia shouldn't be a soapbox, I found SOPA to be borderline at best - and at least SOPA was trying to make a point about a new law that was going to be in place. This protest is about getting something we've ''never had'' (the FCC does not currently regulate net neutrality), and something that would undermine the WMF's efforts with Wikipedia Zero, so clearly this is hardly a clearcut case of needing to act. Plus, as {{u|Alsee}} points out (and as I did in the pipelink), it's pretty clear that this will ''never pass'', so this is an obvious case of [[WP:SNOW]]. Consider that we couldn't even get the main page unified with all mass-surveillance related stuff for [[Stop Watching Us]] - and that's not even a protest, that one was actually fairly neutral. So yeah, I wonder if we can get "participate in such-and-such-protest" added to [[WP:Perennial proposals]] at this point.

* '''Support'''; I would like to see Wikipedia join with other websites in the internet slowdown scheduled for September 10. Wikipedia was very effectively involved with the internet blackout to bring attention to net neutrality issues and I believe that bringing attention to the possibility of the FCC fast lane policy is in the same vein. The potential of tiered service is not something that should be dismissed, and a weak showing of support for even one area of net neutrality weakens other areas. I understand that some of the websites we would be allying ourselves with are not exactly in line with the image Wikipedia tends to portray, but net neutrality is that important. It is about Redtube, Youtube, Netflix, Google, [http://www.dogpile.com/ Dogpile], and Wikipedia all having the same access to their users without a tiered service, without the need to pay ISPs for preferential treatment.
*'''Oppose''' - Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, being encyclopaedic is at the core of our policies and guidelines, we strive to emulate other encyclopaedias, and I don’t see other encyclopaedias getting involved in politics! What is the difference between taking part in this protest and writing a POV article slating the FCC?

This community is based around [[WP:5P|the five pillar policies]], one of which is [[WP:NEU|neutrality]]; if Wikipedia joins a movement, one way or the other, it is in violation of its own core policy. It is better to create a neutral article about the subject, and keep it up for all interested in reading that content's well cited and verified content than to do what occurred during the SOPA shutdown.--[[User:RightCowLeftCoast|RightCowLeftCoast]] ([[User talk:RightCowLeftCoast|talk]]) 07:34, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

== Use &#x7B;{div col}} for categories ==

At present category listings use a fixed 3-up format. I propose that they should use the HTML equivalent of {{tlx|div col|colwidth{{=}}16em}} so that people using the wide windows that seem to be so prevalent these days can see more columns. As an example look at [[list of Pakistani actors]] and change your window width the while. If you have a decent browser, the number of columns will change in response. I have tried this with four different browsers under Android and they too are happy with it.
