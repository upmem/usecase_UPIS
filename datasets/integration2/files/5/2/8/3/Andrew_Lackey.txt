'''Andrew Reid Lackey''' (October 29, 1983 &ndash; July 25, 2013) was a prisoner executed for the October 31, 2005 [[murder]] of Charles Newman, an eighty-year-old World War II veteran. Lackey became the first person executed by the state of [[Alabama]] since October 20, 2011; executions had been partly slowed because of a legal dispute over the drugs being used.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/alabama-executes-andrew-lackey-article-1.1409248 |title=Alabama executes 2005 Halloween killer Andrew Lackey |work=[[NY Daily News]] |agency=Associated Press |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> No further executions would occur in Alabama until the January 2016 execution of Christopher Brooks.

==Murder and arrest==

Lackey broke into Newman's [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone County]] home on [[Halloween]] night in 2005. Lackey had been told by Newman's grandson that there was a vault in the home containing gold bars and cash. Newman made a call to 911 on the night of the murder, in which he could be heard saying, “Don’t do that,” ”Leave me alone” and “What do you want?” Lackey could be heard repeatedly asking, “Where’s the vault?” according to court records.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/usatoday/article/2588153 |title=Ala. inmate in 2005 Halloween killing put to death |work=[[Montgomery Advisor]] |agency=Associated Press |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814073544/http://archive.montgomeryadvertiser.com/usatoday/article/2588153 |archivedate=August 14, 2014 }}</ref> It is believed that Newman grabbed his gun and shot Lackey, who then stabbed Newman with a knife about seventy times. Lackey also shot Newman in the chest with his own gun. Police arrived at the residence five minutes after the call was made, where they found Newman's body.

Lackey drove to a convenience store, where he called an ambulance. He was taken to Huntsville Hospital and treated for the gunshot wound. Police received a phone call indicating that Lackey was at the hospital. He was taken into custody after being released from treatment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/051106/arrest.shtml |title=Suspect charged in Athens killing |work=[[Decatur Daily]] |agency=Associated Press |date=November 6, 2005 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref>

==Trial==
Lackey was charged with capital murder during a burglary, capital murder during a robbery, burglary and robbery. Lackey's attorneys argued that he had a mild form of [[autism]], but did not attempt an insanity defense.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.waff.com/story/7952101/jury-to-begin-deliberations-in-lackey-trial |title=Jury to Begin Deliberations in Lackey Trial |work=WAFF |date=April 1, 2008 |accessdate=September 10, 2015}}</ref>

Psychologist Frank Preston, who examined Lackey, testified that he was socially awkward and showed signs of [[autism]], but overall did not appear to have any serious mental disorder.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.enewscourier.com/x1037412360/lackey-sentenced-to-death/ |title=Lackey sentenced to death |work=[[Athens News Courier]] |agency=Associated Press |date=March 26, 2008 |accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>https://caselaw.findlaw.com/al-court-of-criminal-appeals/1613417.html</ref>

== Execution ==

Following a suicide attempt, Lackey gave up all appeals and asked that an execution date be set. The Equal Justice Initiative (EJI) argued that Lackey, who was diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]] and was taking psychotropic medications, should have undergone a mental health examination. EJI filed papers requesting that Lackey be examined for competency, but this was denied by the Court of Criminal Appeals and the execution was allowed to proceed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eji.org/node/795|title=Equal Justice Initiative|}}</ref>

Andrew Lackey was executed by lethal injection at Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama, on July 25, 2013.
