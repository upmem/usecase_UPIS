[[File:Llanishen.jpg|thumb|right|St Isan's church, [[Llanishen, Monmouthshire]].]]'''Saint Isan''' was a 6th-century [[saint]] of [[South Wales]] and [[Patron Saint]] of [[Llanishen]] near [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]].

He was said to have been a follower of the 6th-century Celtic teacher St [[Illtyd]]. 
In A.D. 535 he and [[Saint Edeyrn]] came eastwards from the small religious settlement of [[Llandaff]], aiming to establish [[church building|churches]], in the area around [[Caerphilly mountain]]. The sites they choose had fresh water from the Nant Fawr stream.

Isan founded his church on the site of the modern-day Oval at [[Llanishen]].

His co-worker Edeyrn was reputed to have travelled widely, and as a result there are churches in [[North Wales|North]] and [[South Wales]] dedicated to his memory. St Edeyrn gathered together a community of about 300 that lived and worshipped in the [[Llanedeyrn]] area.

Isan is remembered in churches at [[Llanishen, Monmouthshire]] and [[Llanishen]], Cardiff.
