Fails [[WP:ORG]]. Not a notable organization. What's worse, there appears to be two different but separate organizations! One based in Oklahoma and one based in <s>India</s> Canada. [[User:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps]] ([[User talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk]]) 00:37, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' No evidence of notability. Subject fails GNG and ORG. Sources fail RS. Google yielded nothing that rings the N Bell. -[[User:Ad Orientem|Ad Orientem]] ([[User talk:Ad Orientem|talk]]) 00:45, 14 August 2014 (UTC)

*'''Delete'''. I did find where the ICR is mentioned in [http://books.google.com/books?id=a1viOaH6BhYC&pg=PA279&dq=%22Institute+for+Consciousness+Research%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dC3sU_uiG8nmyAT6yoHIAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Institute%20for%20Consciousness%20Research%22&f=false this book], but this isn't enough to show notability to the point where we'd keep the article. There are other sources, but they'd be considered [[WP:SPS]] and/or too [[WP:FRINGE]] for Wikipedia to consider them usable as a RS.

*'''Delete'''. Per above, and because half the article's refs are taken from the ICR's own publications. --[[User:Seduisant|Seduisant]] ([[User talk:Seduisant|talk]]) 19:34, 14 August 2014 (UTC)
