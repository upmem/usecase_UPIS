{{short description|Australian physicist}}
Professor '''Margaret Reid''' from [[Swinburne University of Technology]] (Melbourne, Australia) is a [[list of Fellows of the Australian Academy of Science|Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]]. She is known for her pioneering work in new fundamental tests of [[Quantum theory of matter|quantum theory]], including [[teleportation]] and [[cryptography]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Margaret Reid elected Fellow for work in quantum theory, including teleportation and cryptography |url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media-centre/news/2014/03/margaret-reid-elected-fellow-for-work-in-quantum-theory-including-teleportation-and-cryptography.html |publisher=[[Swinburne University]] |access-date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

== Career ==
Reid graduated from the [[University of Auckland]] with an M.Sc. degree in theoretical physics and then undertook Ph.D. studies in New Zealand with [[Dan Walls]] FRS, graduating in 1984. She developed theories for the generation of squeezed states of light and quantum non-demolition measurement. Following several years as a lecturer at the [[University of Waikato]], New Zealand, she was awarded an Australian QEII Fellowship to do research at the [[University of Queensland]]. She later became a researcher with the Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Quantum and Atom Optics at the [[University of Queensland]].<ref>[http://www.physics.uq.edu.au/BEC/ Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence in Quantum and Atom Optics]</ref> She is currently Professor at [[Swinburne University of Technology]] in Melbourne and works as a researcher within the Centre for Quantum and Optical Sciences.

== Research ==
Reid's work has focussed on the fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, including of the [[EPR paradox|Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen]] paradox and [[Bell's theorem]], based on parametric down conversion and quantum optics. On working with squeezed states of light in the 1980s, Reid thought of a way to test for the original Einstein's entanglement, after noting scientists were able to amplify and detect the tiny quantum fluctuations of optical amplitudes.
Experiments since have confirmed this mesoscopic type of Einstein's entanglement in a range of environments, which enables a closer to understanding to [[Schrödinger's cat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theconversation.com/einstein-vs-quantum-mechanics-and-why-hed-be-a-convert-today-27641 |title=Einstein vs quantum mechanics ... and why he'd be a convert today |publisher=Theconversation.com |access-date=2014-08-14}}</ref>

Einstein's scepticism about quantum mechanics may lead to an ultra-secure internet suggests a new paper by researchers from Swinburne University of Technology and Peking University.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In a landmark publication,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal | last=He | first=Q. Y. | last2=Reid | first2=M. D. | title=Genuine Multipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering | journal=Physical Review Letters | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=111 | issue=25 | date=2013-12-18 | issn=0031-9007 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.111.250403 | page=250403| hdl=1959.3/371483 | hdl-access=free }}</ref> Reid's research group outlined Einstein's reservations about quantum mechanics in a phenomenon known as "'spooky' action at a distance".  In 1935 Einstein and researchers highlighted a 'spooky' theory in quantum mechanics, which is the strange way entangled particles stay connected even when separated by large distances.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

In this paper,<ref name="autogenerated1"/> theoretical proof that such messages can be shared between more than two people and may provide unprecedented security for a future quantum internet is provided for the first time.

In the 1990s, scientists realised one can securely transmit a message through encrypting and using a shared key generated by Einstein's strange entanglement to decode the message from the sender and receiver. Using the quantum key meant the message was completely secure from interception during transmission.

Sending Einstein's entanglement to a larger number of people means the key can be distributed among all the receiving parties, so they must collaborate to decipher the message, which makes the message even more secure.

The report that a secure message can be shared by up to three to four people, opening the possibility to the theory being applicable to secure messages being sent from many to many. The message will also remain secure if the devices receiving the message have been tampered with, like if an iPhone were hacked, because of the nature of Einstein's spooky entanglement.

Discovering that it can be applied to a situation with more parties has the potential to create a more secure internet – with less messages being intercepted from external parties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swinburne.edu.au/media-centre/news/2014/03/einsteins-scepticism-about-quantum-mechanics-may-lead-to-ultra-secure-internet.html |title=March - Einstein's scepticism about quantum mechanics may lead to ultra-secure internet - Swinburne University of Technology |publisher=Swinburne.edu.au |date=2014-03-25 |access-date=2014-08-14}}</ref>

== Honours and Awards ==
For Reid's contributions to the fields of quantum entanglement and non-locality, she was made a fellow of the [[The Optical Society|Optical Society of America]] and a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]]. She was also awarded a visiting position at [[Harvard University]] and a JILA Fellowship at the [[University of Colorado]] in the USA.

The Fellowship of the Australian Academy of Science (received in 2014) is a great accomplishment for any Australian scientist, but Reid sees it as further recognition for women scientists: "The idea that women are in any way inferior when it comes to doing physics or mathematics is a complete myth. Unfortunately, a big problem is that not all the great achievements made by the women physicists of the last century were properly recognised. But that has and will continue to change as more and more women are recognised for their contributions to science." <ref>{{cite web|date=2014-03-26|title=March - Margaret Reid elected Fellow for work in quantum theory, including teleportation and cryptography - Swinburne University of Technology|url=http://www.swin.edu.au/media-centre/news/2014/03/margaret-reid-elected-fellow-for-work-in-quantum-theory-including-teleportation-and-cryptography.html|access-date=2014-08-14|publisher=Swin.edu.au}}</ref>
