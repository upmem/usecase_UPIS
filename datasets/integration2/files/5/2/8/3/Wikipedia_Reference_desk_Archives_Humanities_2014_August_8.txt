== Elizabeth Sinclair ==

Can anybody help me find some genealogical information on the three sons of [[Elizabeth Sinclair]]? I am having troubke since Elizabeth Sinclair is a pretty common name.--[[User:KAVEBEAR|KAVEBEAR]] ([[User talk:KAVEBEAR|talk]]) 04:00, 8 August 2014 (UTC)

:It looks like none of them had children. George died at sea with his father in 1846; James was "an invalid" and apparently died unmarried and childless; Francis Sinclair (1833–1916) married twice but seems to have had no children. More on Francis Sinclair Jr. [http://press.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Watriama+and+Co%3A+Further+Pacific+Islands+Portraits/10821/ch02.xhtml here].--[[User:Cam|Cam]] ([[User talk:Cam|talk]]) 14:21, 8 August 2014 (UTC)
::When was James born and when did he die? And when was George born?--[[User:KAVEBEAR|KAVEBEAR]] ([[User talk:KAVEBEAR|talk]]) 04:24, 9 August 2014 (UTC)
:And here's the family tree, although it omits the sons, only listing the daughters: [[Niihau#Sinclair-Robinson_family_tree]]. Presumably they are omitted due to their lack of issue. [[User:StuRat|StuRat]] ([[User talk:StuRat|talk]]) 03:51, 9 August 2014 (UTC)
::It's on her article too. That's why I asked about the sons.--[[User:KAVEBEAR|KAVEBEAR]] ([[User talk:KAVEBEAR|talk]]) 04:24, 9 August 2014 (UTC)
:::I found dates for George (1820–1846) and James (1825–1873) on ancestry.com, perhaps not a reliable source in the Wikipedian sense.--[[User:Cam|Cam]] ([[User talk:Cam|talk]]) 12:42, 9 August 2014 (UTC)

== Yellow River ==

Was the Yellow River really a tributary of the Yangtze River in the 13th and 14th century? [http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Excursions/Huang-He-history.jpg]

:According to [[Yellow_River#Medieval_times]], for a while it drained into a lake, which drained into the Yangtze. But the claim is flagged {{citation needed}}. Seems plausible enough to me, especially considering our article references several other documented changes in course. It seems to have been a rather dynamic river.
