'''Josephine Forbes''' (born 20 August 1970) is an Australian scientist specialising in the study of [[glycation]] and [[diabetes]]. She has been studying diabetes since 1999 and has worked at Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne and Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne Australia. Since 2012 she has led the Glycation and Diabetes team at [http://materresearch.org.au Mater Research] which is a world-class medical research institute based at South Brisbane, and part of the [http://www.mater.org.au Mater Group]. Josephine is program leader for Mater's Chronic Disease Biology and Care theme, building greater understanding of the biological basis of a broad range of chronic diseases, and developing preventative strategies and innovative treatments to improve patient outcomes. Josephine and her team focus on how advanced glycation contributes to the [[pathogenesis]] of [[diabetes]] and its complications such as [[kidney disease]].<ref name="mater-profile">{{cite web|title=Professor Josephine Forbes|url=http://www.materresearch.org.au/researchers/chronic-disease-biology-and-care/glycation-and-diabetes-complications/professor-josephine-forbes}}</ref>

== Research ==
Professor Forbes' research focuses on the process of advanced [[glycation]] and its contribution to [[diabetes]] and its complications, in particular [[kidney disease]]. Her recent work includes research into how advanced glycation of food by modern processing techniques and storage may be contributing to our diabetes epidemic.<ref name="the-conversation" />

Her research aims to find medicines which reduce the accumulation of products of advanced glycation, which in turn will impact the incidence of diabetes and kidney disease. Her research also aims to provide information to food regulatory authorities and health care providers about advanced glycation in food and the implications of ingesting this in excess.<ref name="nhmrc" />

So far this research has identified a class of medicines which appears to be effective for the treatment of kidney disease in diabetes, and also affects how our bodies process sugar. In the food area, she has conducted a clinical trial in overweight individuals examining the effects of advanced glycation products in food on their sugar handling and kidney function. Her team is also part of a large clinical trial tracking the consumption of advanced glycation products by mothers and their babies to see if there is an association with this and the development of Type 1 diabetes in later life.<ref name="nhmrc" />

Her work to date has resulted in more than 100 publications with more than 4500 citations.
