'''Emma Letitia Johnston''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO|FTSE|FRSN}} (born 1973) is the Dean of Science at the [[University of New South Wales]] and President of [[Science & Technology Australia]]. She is an authority in [[marine ecology]] and a former [[Pro-vice-chancellor|Pro Vice-Chancellor]] (Research) at UNSW. 

Johnston is head of the Applied Marine and Estuarine Ecology Lab at UNSW and has led major projects for industry, government, the [[Australian Research Council]] and the [[Australian Antarctic Division|Australian Antarctic]] Science Program. 

Johnston was the inaugural Director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program<ref>{{cite web |author=The Creative Company |url=http://harbourprogram.sims.org.au |title=Sydney Institute of Marine Science » The Sydney Harbour Research Program |publisher=Harbourprogram.sims.org.au |accessdate=2014-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209122154/http://harbourprogram.sims.org.au/ |archive-date=9 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> at the Sydney Institute of Marine Science.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sims.org.au/ |title=The Sydney Institute of Marine Science |publisher=Sims |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref> 

Johnston's research group at UNSW investigates the [[ecology]] of human impacts in marine systems, combining the diverse disciplines of ecology, [[microbiology]] and [[ecotoxicology]] to expand fundamental understanding and provide recommendations for management.  Her research is conducted in such diverse field environments as [[Sydney Harbour National Park|Sydney Harbour]], [[Antarctica]], the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and temperate Australian [[Estuary|estuaries]]. 

{{As of|2017}}, Johnston has published over 112 peer-reviewed works.<ref>https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-emma-johnston/publications</ref>

== Early life ==
Born in 1973, to parents who were both scientists at that time, Johnston studied physics and chemistry in high school, not biology. However, being a keen sailor from a very young age and interested in all things to do with the water, she decided to focus on biology in her undergraduate degree ([[Bachelor of Science]]) at the [[University of Melbourne]], which she completed in 1998 with first class Honours. 

Johnston completed her PhD in [[marine ecology]] in 2002 at the University of Melbourne under the supervision of [[Mick Keough]].

She joined [[UNSW]] as an associate lecturer in 2001 and is now Dean of Science.<ref name="Ross"/>

==Career==

===Research===
Among Johnston's significant research findings is the discovery that toxic contaminants facilitate the invasion of coastal waterways by [[non-indigenous species]]. Some of her research topics include: determining the major drivers of marine bio-invasions, the vulnerability of Antarctic marine communities, and developing new [[biomonitoring]] techniques and informing the development of effective management of [[biodiversity]] in Australian [[estuarine]] systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=NDFto44AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&cstart=80 |title=Emma L Johnston - Google Scholar Citations |publisher=Scholar.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>

===Other activities===
Johnston is also a high profile science communicator, winning the 2015 [[Eureka Prizes|Eureka Prize]] for Promoting Understanding of Australian Science Research. She is a regular media commentator and, as [[television presenter|co-presenter]] of the [[Foxtel]]/[[BBC]] television series ''[[Coast Australia]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mercer |first=Cassie |date=2 December 2013 |title=A cup of tea with… Neil Oliver: Host of Foxtel's new Coast Australia |url=http://www.insidehistory.com.au/2013/12/a-cup-of-tea-with-neil-oliver-host-of-foxtels-new-coast-australia/ |newspaper=Inside History |location=[[Sydney]], [[Australia]] |accessdate=15 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814100901/http://www.insidehistory.com.au/2013/12/a-cup-of-tea-with-neil-oliver-host-of-foxtels-new-coast-australia/ |archive-date=14 August 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> has helped take Australian marine science to an international audience. She also launched a Sydney Harbour cruise called ''Underwater Secrets' – Sydney Harbour Revealed'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harbourprogram.sims.org.au/blog/2013/04/underwater-secrets-sydney-harbour-revealed-the-harbour-cruise-with-a-difference|title=Sydney Institute of Marine Science » Underwater Secrets - Sydney Harbour Revealed.

As President of [[Science & Technology Australia]], Professor Johnston is also a public advocate for science and for increasing the participation of women in research. 

== Awards ==
Johnston's research has led to her being a category winner in the 2012 NSW Science and Engineering Awards and in 2014 she won the inaugural [[Australian Academy of Science]] Nancy Millis Medal for Women in Science.<ref name="Ross">{{cite news |last=Ross |first=John |date=7 March 2014 |title=Marine ecologist takes out new award |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/marine-ecologist-takes-out-new-award/story-e6frgcjx-1226848286195?nk=26ee00862a7ddc7817743a298a4cead6 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=[[Surry Hills, New South Wales]], [[Australia]] |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref> This medal was presented to Johnston at Science at the [[Shine Dome]] on 28 May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|author=Starts:&nbsp; 8:30am |url=http://www.science.org.au/events/science-shine-dome-2014 |title=Science at the Shine Dome 2014 - Australian Academy of Science |publisher=Science.org.au |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}</ref>
