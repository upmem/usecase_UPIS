'''''Dirty Politics: How attack politics is poisoning New Zealand’s political environment''''' is a book by [[Nicky Hager]] published in August 2014.

The book is based on emails hacked from [[Cameron Slater]]'s [[Gmail]] account and on [[Facebook]] chats. These communications occurred around the same time that a [[Denial-of-service attack|denial-of-service]] (DOS) attack took down Slater's website – the right-wing blog ''Whale Oil Beef Hooked'' – and feature hundreds of items of correspondence in which prominent New Zealanders are criticised and vilified. Hager's book describes a lengthy history of correspondence between Slater and Justice Minister [[Judith Collins]] that eventually contributed to her resignation as a Minister. In response to the allegations in the book, Prime Minister [[John Key]] said that he talked to Slater on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/9723130/Looks-like-Slater-is-Keys-Peters-source|title= Looks like Slater is Key's Peters source|work= Stuff.co.nz}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://tvnz.co.nz/seven-sharp/whaleoil-beef-hooked-video-6035344 |title= WhaleOil Beef Hooked|work= Seven Sharp|date= 22 July 2014}}</ref> Hager claimed that using bloggers rather than journalists allowed Key to maintain a friendly public persona, while using right-wing blogs as a vehicle to attack opponents.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10395382/Hacked-emails-revealed-online |title= Hacked emails revealed online |work= Stuff |date= 18 August 2014}}</ref> Other bloggers mentioned in the book include Matthew Hooten, [[Cathy Odgers]] ( who goes by the name of Cactus Kate<ref>[http://publicaddress.net/speaker/confidential-information-the-legal-rights/ Confidential information: the legal rights and wrongs], Public Address 15 August 2014</ref>) and [[David Farrar (blogger)|David Farrar]].<ref>

However, Hager reserves his strongest criticism for Cameron Slater, who he says received payment to write attack articles on public figures who opposed or criticised [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] policy – and ''Dirty Politics'' identifies those who paid him.

==Background==
Whale Oil Beef Hooked (generally referred to as WhaleOil) is the personal blog of Cameron Slater which he started in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/about/ |work=Whale Oil Beef Hooked |title=About}}</ref> Slater, the son of former National Party president John Slater,<ref name="NZSST2009-A">{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/2583835/Internet-warrior |work=Sunday Star Times|date=12 July 2009|title=Internet warrior}}</ref> claims WhaleOil is a "super-blog" attracting over one million unique visits every month. He admitted at that time to suffering from depression and has a reputation for vitriol and anger. He said in 2010 that he didn't care if people regarded him as 'stupid, a bully, or vicious' but would resent being called a hypocrite.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10669406 | title=Michele Hewitson Interview: Cameron Slater |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=28 August 2010}}</ref>

In January 2014, WhaleOil was hacked some time after he posted a blog post with the headline ''"Feral dies in Greymouth, did world a favour."'' Three other children in this family had already been killed in accidents and the post provoked a 'furious public reaction'. Some weeks later, Hager received an 8 gigabyte USB stick in the mail containing thousands of pages of emails hacked from Slater's website.<ref>Dirty Politics, Nicky Hager, Craig Potton Publishing, 2014, p 12.</ref> Hager contacted the hacker, known as Rawshark,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10442284/Judith-Collins-resigns-says-shes-a-victim |title=Judith Collins resigns, says she's a victim |work=The Dominion Post |date= 30 August 2014}}</ref> and persuaded him that putting the information in a book would provide "something more lasting and of bigger value" than releasing it on [[Twitter]]. Hager says Rawshark was motivated by his dislike of Slater, and that he secretly met the hacker in public parks to discuss how the information should be released. He then spent a significant amount of time analysing the content and only published material which he believed was in the public interest. He was careful to avoid releasing sensitive material about Slater and others mentioned in the hacked emails which did not involve a significant public interest.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10442363/Hagers-relationship-with-hacker-revealed | title=Hager's relationship with hacker revealed | newspaper=The Press | date=30 August 2014 | accessdate=30 August 2014 | last=Napier |first=Abbie}}</ref>

===Production===
The production, printing, and distribution of the book was done in secret by [[Potton & Burton|Craig Potton Publishing]]. Co-owner of the publishing company, Robbie Burton, said: "It was one of the great and surreal and scary moments of my publishing career." Burton said the secrecy was necessary because they were wary that the book might annoy some people with "deep pockets" who "might be inclined to revenge". The book was produced very quickly by Craig Potton Publishing, where staff worked on it from Thursday evening to the following Tuesday. Once the book was finished, first it was printed in secret in Wellington, before being shipped back to Nelson and stored in a warehouse, and then finally being sent unannounced to stores around the country.<ref name="Key's days numbered">{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10514222/Keys-days-are-numbered-Hager | title=Key's days are numbered – Hager | work=Stuff | date=18 September 2014 | accessdate=18 September 2014 | author=Anderson, Charles}}</ref>

==Release==
[[File:Nicky Hager-DirtyPolsLaunch1.jpg|thumbnail|Hager speaking to journalists outside the launch of ''Dirty Politics'']]
''Dirty Politics'' was released at [[Unity Books]] in Wellington on 13 August 2014, with a crowd of approximately 150.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wellington.scoop.co.nz/?p=69809 | title=Dirty Politics: Nicky Hager's new book on the Key Government launched at Unity | publisher=Scoop | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=14 August 2014 | author=Craig Potton Publishing}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11308353 | title=Hager book: 'You will not believe what you read' | work=The New Zealand Herald | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=14 August 2014 | first1=David |last1=Fisher |first2=Adam |last2=Bennet}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Nicky-Hager-book-shows-Nationals-dirty-politics/tabid/1607/articleID/356716/Default.aspx | title=Nicky Hager book shows National's 'dirty politics' | work=3 News | date=13 August 2014 | accessdate=14 August 2014 | author=Wong, Simon}}</ref> Prior to the release of the book, details of what it would be about were the subject of substantial speculation, as the topic of the book was kept secret in order to avoid it being blocked from release by a court injunction.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10381072/Hager-book-a-smear-campaign-Key | title=Hager book a smear campaign: Key | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=14 August 2014 | accessdate=3 September 2014}}</ref>

Four days after release, it had sold about 10,000 copies, in addition to 1,000 [[e-book]] sales. Robbie Burton, executive director of Craig Potton Publishing, said: "I've never seen anything like this before, in terms of the speed at which it's happening."<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/entertainment/books/10395853/Demand-for-Dirty-Politics-stays-strong | title=Demand for Dirty Politics stays strong | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=18 August 2014 | accessdate=3 September 2014 | last=Kenny |first=Katie}}</ref> A week after release, sales had reached approximately 15,000,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radiolive.co.nz/AUDIO-Dirty-politics-book-sales-hit-15-thousand---and-hit-National-in-the-polls/tabid/506/articleID/52889/Default.aspx | title=AUDIO: Dirty politics book sales hit 15 thousand – and hit National in the polls | work=Newstalk ZB | date=22 August 2014 | accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> and by mid September, sales were at almost 20,000.<ref name="Key's days numbered"/> The first two chapters are [https://web.archive.org/web/20141018233139/http://www.craigpotton.co.nz/flipbooks/dirty_politics/index.html available free] on-line.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/opinion/dirty-politics-publisher-makes-two-chapters-free-online |title=Dirty Politics publisher makes two chapters free online |author=Keall, Chris |work=National Business Review |date=12 September 2014}}</ref>

Two weeks after the release of the book, Hager spoke at the four-day biennial Writers & Readers Festival in Christchurch. About 5000 people attended 57 events, one of which was a public discussion called Secrets, Spies and Free Speech featuring ''Dirty Politics'' author Nicky Hager, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist Luke Harding and Australian journalist Richard King. The discussion was mainly about the freedom of speech in Western democracies.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/10444642 WORD festival the most successful yet], Stuff, 1 September 2014</ref>

==Main features==
Hager provides numerous incidents of dirty politics in the book. He describes multiple email exchanges between Cameron Slater and National Party spin doctor Jason Ede<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10392956/Jason-Ede-still-has-Beehive-access |title=Jason Ede still has Beehive access |work=Stuff |date=17 August 2014}}</ref> who works for Prime Minister John Key. Up till August 2011 Mr Ede was employed by Ministerial Services and, in effect, was paid by the taxpayer. Hager says Ede tried to avoid scrutiny by using a 'dynamic' IP address, one that changed frequently making it difficult for him to be identified. When the book was published, Mr Ede was employed by the National Party, rather than by John Key, but was still working from the Prime Minister's office.<ref name="Brent Edwards power play">{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/252164/denial-and-disarray-over-hager-book |title=POWER PLAY with Brent Edwards |work=Radio New Zealand|date=15 August 2014}}</ref> He resigned the day before the election.

''Dirty Politics'' also describes numerous email contacts between Cameron Slater and Judith Collins who are long-time friends. The email records span from 2009 to 2014 covering the entire time she was in Cabinet. One particular email shows that Collins asked Slater to edit her Wikipedia page and sent him a new photo with the message: "Cam, any chance of a better photo going up?? Eek it looks really bad."<ref name="Rawshark">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=David |title=Rawshark files: The blogger and the politician |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11319024 |accessdate=10 September 2014 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=4 September 2014}}</ref> Slater appears to have obliged using the pseudonym 'Jc press sec',{{refn|group=nb|Collins' photo was changed in February 2013 subsequent to {{srlink|Talk:Judith Collins#Replace photo|this discussion}} by {{srlink|User:Jc press sec|Jc press sec}}, and ''The Herald'' reporting confirms that it was Slater who was acting for Collins.}} which was subsequently changed to {{srlink|User talk:Polkad0t|Polkad0t}}.<ref name="Rawshark" /><ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Phil |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10897474 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304221750/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10897474 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title=Justice Minister's 'wikispat': Who is Clarke43? |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=12 July 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>

In return, Slater also asked Collins for favours. The emails indicate Slater asked Ms Collins to get a prisoner moved to a different prison, while she was Minister of Corrections.<ref name="Brent Edwards power play"/> Slater asked Collins to get him moved because he was friends with the prisoner's ex-wife, who wanted the man moved further away from their daughter who had been visiting him in prison.

The more serious allegations in ''Dirty Politics'' are described below. Radio New Zealand political editor Brent Edwards says that while the book is not always definitive,
{{cquote|it includes enough evidence to suggest National has orchestrated a campaign of political vilification using bloggers, Cameron Slater in particular, to do the dirty work. Some bloggers... have no compunction using material even if its veracity is questionable. Cameron Slater – and the extent to which he is prepared to go – takes attack politics to a whole new plane.<ref name="Brent Edwards power play"/>}}

=== The Labour Party website ===
One of the main allegations is that during the 2011 election campaign, Cameron Slater and Jason Ede took advantage of a badly-configured website to enter the database of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] website. This enabled them to look at emails and personal details which were then used to attack the Labour Party. 18,000 emails, lists of the party's donors and supporters<ref name="Brent Edwards power play"/> and their credit-card transactions were downloaded. The book reveals Mr Slater and Mr Ede both accessed the site more than once and then "plotted how best to reveal the downloaded material on Mr Slater's blog".<ref name="Rudman someone else does it">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11311371 |title=Brian Rudman: It's only dirty politics when someone else does it |work= New Zealand Herald |date= 20 August 2014}}</ref> Slater did not deny he had accessed the website in May 2011, and said: "I was certainly into the backend of the Labour Party's website, if they couldn't manage security of their website, their credit card details and financial information about their membership, well then they weren't really fit for government at the time."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/252281/national-involved-in-breach-labour | title=National involved in breach – Labour | work=Radio New Zealand News | date=17 August 2014 | accessdate=18 October 2014}}</ref>

Hager alleges that material from the website breach was selectively released by Slater, starting from 12 June.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/252252/dirty-politics-claims,-counter-claims | title=Dirty Politics: claims, counter-claims | work=Radio New Zealand News | date=16 August 2014 | accessdate=18 October 2014 | author=McCulloch, Craig}}</ref>

In response to being accused of illegally accessing the Labour website, Slater published a blog post titled "My confession: How I accessed the Labour Party web site". In the post, he shows how he claims to have accessed information on four Labour party websites, and denies allegations of "hacking". Using easily accessible links, he could view all the files on the web server, including sensitive membership and credit card information which was unencrypted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2014/08/confession-accessed-labour-party-web-site/ | title=My confession: How I accessed the Labour Party web site | work=Whale Oil | accessdate=25 September 2014 | author=Slater, Cameron}}</ref>

Mr Key also claimed there was nothing wrong with Jason Ede accessing the Labour Party website because "they left their website open."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10392956/Jason-Ede-still-has-Beehive-access |title=Jason Ede still has Beehive access |work= Stuff |date= 17 August 2014}}</ref> He justified the action to Radio New Zealand by saying: "If the Wallabies on Tuesday night had left their starting line-up up on their website, on their private website, would the All Blacks go and have a look? The answer is yes. The reason I know that is it's happened."<ref name="Rudman someone else does it" />

=== The Security Intelligence Service ===
Another allegation is that in 2011, the Prime Minister's office facilitated the release of confidential [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]] (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass [[Phil Goff]]. Slater made an [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|second Christchurch earthquake]] – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed.<ref name="Key's staff to be grilled">{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/10448659/Keys-staff-to-be-grilled-over-Goff-claim |title=Key's staff to be grilled over Goff claim |work=The Press |date=2 September 2014}}</ref> Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in ''Dirty Politics'' suggest he knew what was in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=11312473 |title=Toby Manhire: Amid the dirt, here's a glossary |work=New Zealand Herald |date=22 August 2014}}</ref> Goff believes this inside information could only have come from the SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.<ref name="Key's staff to be grilled" />

=== Attacks on public servant ===
The book also presents evidence which suggests that Justice Minister [[Judith Collins]] leaked the name of public servant, Simon Pleasants, to Cameron Slater. Pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at [[Department of Internal Affairs (New Zealand)|Internal Affairs]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11311222 |title=Judith Collins on her last chance – Key |work=The New Zealand Herald}}</ref> and Collins assumed he was responsible for leaking details of Mr English's accommodation payments to Labour in 2009. Slater then published a series of blog attacks on Pleasants – who subsequently received a torrent of abuse including death threats. Pleasants denies ever leaking any information about English.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/national/10399104/I-wouldn-t-leak-to-blogger-English |title=Key: Collins subject of 'smear campaign' |work=The Press}}</ref>

Nick Bryant, [[Gerry Brownlee]]'s press secretary is identified in ''Dirty Politics'' as the user of the pseudonym "Former Hack" to post anonymous comments on Whaleoil encouraging Cameron Slater's campaign against Pleasants. On 23 August, ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' reported it was able to confirm the use of Mr Bryant's ministerial computer and subsequently revealed that hundreds of messages were sent from ministerial or government computers to the comments section of Slater's blog. The messages are linked to email addresses on government servers and [[IP address]]es from which they were posted.<ref name="Nick Bryant">{{Cite news| title=Minister's staffer took part in blog| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11313039 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |first=David |last=Fisher |date=23 August 2014 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref>

=== Commercial 'hit' jobs ===
''Dirty Politics'' also refers to hacked emails which suggest Slater allowed his website to be used for commercial "hit" jobs supplied by PR consultant, Carrick Graham, whose clients include tobacco and alcohol companies. For instance, Slater has frequently used his WhaleOil blog to attack Professor Doug Sellman, a leading authority on addiction and an outspoken critic of the alcohol industry<ref name="Blogging, money and blurred lines">[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10391846/Blogging-money-and-blurred-lines Blogging, money and blurred lines], Stuff 17 August 2014</ref> posting blogs with pejorative titles such as “Confirmed: Doug Sellman Gone Mad”. These were based on information supplied by Carrick Graham,<ref>[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1408/S00297/evidence-of-the-dubious-tactics-of-the-alcohol-industry.htm Evidence of the dubious tactics of the alcohol industry], Scoop 19 August 2014</ref> son of former National party member [[Doug Graham|Sir Douglas Graham]]. Hager says Carrick Graham's company, Facilitate Communications, paid Slater $6,555 a month and speculated that it was for him to do attack blogs.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11309420 Cunliffe: Dirty Politics allegations like Watergate], ''New Zealand Herald'', 15 August 2014</ref>

=== Katherine Rich ===
Former National MP [[Katherine Rich]], the chief executive of the NZ Food and Grocery Council, is implicated in the book. Emails show that information she passed to Carrick Graham was passed on to Slater. Slater then used the information to attack health campaigners such as Professor Doug Sellman<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11309420 |title=Cunliffe: Dirty Politics allegations like Watergate |work= The New Zealand Herald |date=15 August 2014}}</ref> who campaigns about liquor legislation and ''New Zealand Herald'' columnist Wendyl Nissen,<ref name="The New Zealand Herald">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11325097 |title=Wendyl Nissen: Tuning out: Dirty Politics and the blogs |work= The New Zealand Herald |date= 16 September 2014}}</ref>  who writes about additives and healthy food.

New Zealand allows 14 additives that have been banned or never allowed in the European Union or the United States and in her role at the New Zealand Food and Grocery Council, Katherine Rich, has claimed all additives used in New Zealand are safe.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10845593 Additives safe, say food makers], NZ Herald, 7 November 2012</ref> Ms Nissen said she was attacked because Katherine Rich objected to her "highlighting the use of artificial colours commonly used in soft drinks and processed foods and the fact many had been banned in other countries."<ref name="The New Zealand Herald"/> Confirming his connection with Katherine Rich, Slater publicly acknowledged that she had paid him twice, but claimed it was for speaking at conferences<ref name="Blogging, money and blurred lines"/> not for writing blog articles.<ref>{{cite web|last1=British Medical Journal|title=Katherine Rich replies to Martin McKee|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6447|accessdate=11 June 2015|date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

However, in 2012, the National Government appointed Rich to the board of the Health Promotional Agency, which runs campaigns to promote healthier lifestyles. In this capacity, Katherine Rich's primary role is to promote public health, suggesting her involvement with the Food and Grocery Council means she has a conflict of interest. Once the allegations in Dirty Politics became public, a group of 33 scientists and health practitioners were so concerned they wrote to John Key asking him to investigate Rich's apparent conflict of interest.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11325097 Wendyl Nissen: Tuning out: Dirty Politics and the blogs], NZ Herald 16 September 2014</ref>

Green Party health spokesperson [[Kevin Hague]] said Rich should resign, arguing that "Katherine Rich, Carrick Graham and Cameron Slater have all been involved in a systematic undermining of health promotion in New Zealand. She cannot tenably remain on the board of that organisation."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253770/food-council-boss-won't-resign |title=Food council boss won't resign |work=Radio New Zealand| date=4 September 2014}}</ref> Rich responded by saying she had never been involved in undermining public health and found the claim very offensive. She said she put her heart and soul into the Health Promotion Agency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253770/food-council-boss-won%27t-resign |title=Food council boss won't resign &#124; Radio New Zealand News |publisher=Radionz.co.nz |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> and adhered to all parts of the Crown Entities Act.

Nevertheless, the Auditor-General was asked to investigate and conducted a review of the HPA’s board minutes. It declared "we have not identified any particular matters before, or decisions by, the HPA board that might raise serious concerns about its management of conflicts of interest". However, the Auditor-General acknowledged they did not interview Ms Rich, nor did they investigate "allegations in Nicky Hager’s 2014 book Dirty Politics about things Mrs Rich is said to have done in her private capacity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/media/2015/health-promotion-agency |title=Health Promotion Agency – Katherine Rich – possible conflicts of interest — Office of the Auditor-General New Zealand |publisher=Oag.govt.nz |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref> Rich said she felt vindicated by the finding, but the Green Party called for an additional investigation by the [[State Services Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kate Newton |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/273643/rich-%27vindicated%27-by-food-council-inquiry |title=Rich 'vindicated' by food council inquiry |work=Radionz.co.nz |date=14 May 2015 |accessdate=10 June 2015}}</ref>

==Further revelations==

=== Attacks on the Serious Fraud Office ===
On 30 August, John Key released an email written by Slater in 2011 suggesting Judith Collins was also 'gunning' for former [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] (SFO) boss Adam Feely.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11316644 I'm the victim of a smear campaign: Judith Collins resigns], ''New Zealand Herald'', 30 August 2014</ref> Collins was the Minister responsible for the SFO at the time, and the email said: "Any information that we can provide her [Collins] on his [Feely's] background is appreciated."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11316677 | title=The email that brought down Judith Collins |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=30 August 2014}}</ref> It was addressed to 'Mark' (with the surname redacted) and Carrick Graham.

Other emails, released to [[Fairfax Media]] by Rawshark, appear to suggest that 'Mark' is former Hanover Finance director [[Mark Hotchin]].

=== Release of emails on @WhaleDump ===
Prime Minister John Key characterised ''Dirty Politics'' as a "cynically timed attack" from "a well known left wing{{sic}} conspiracy theorist".<ref name="stuff Watkins">{{cite news |last1=Watkins |first1=Tracy |title=Hager: Book exposes National 'attack politics' |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10376693/Hager-Book-exposes-National-attack-politics |accessdate=5 September 2014 |work=[[stuff.co.nz]]|date=13 August 2014}}</ref> In response to Key's criticism that the book's publication so close to the [[2014 New Zealand general election|2014 general election]] was designed to be a political bombshell, Hager says he published the material that was provided to him in March 2014 as soon as he could. Rather than being timed for maximum political damage, Hager says "it was actually just the practicalities of how fast I could get it out."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/23/-sp-new-zealand-election-john-key-alleged-dirty-politics |title=The whale that swallowed New Zealand's election campaign |work=The Guardian |date=23 August 2014}}</ref>

Mr Key went on to say the book "makes all sorts of unfounded allegations and voters will see it for what it is."<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11308353 | title = Hager book: 'You will not believe what you read' |first1=David |last1=Fisher |first2=Adam |last2=Bennet |work = The New Zealand Herald | date = 13 August 2014}}</ref> He also accused Nicky Hager of joining "a whole lot of dots that can't be connected."<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10381072/Hager-book-a-smear-campaign-Key Hager book a smear campaign: Key], Stuff, 14 August 2014</ref> Key said: "[Hager] didn't do what a true journalist would do.

In response, Hager spoke to his source to try to get back some of the emails that the book was based on in order to release them online. The hacker, known as Rawshark, apparently said: "Leave this to me" and began releasing the emails through an account on Twitter, @WhaleDump.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10395382/Hacked-emails-revealed-online Hacked emails revealed online], Stuff, 18 August 2014</ref> The emails seem to back up many of the claims Hager makes in the book.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253685/emails-seem-to-back-hager-claims Emails seem to back Hager claims], RNZ, 3 September</ref><ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11311764 More documents cast doubt on Key claims], ''NZ Herald'', 21 August 2014</ref> The hacker also communicated with journalists using encryption to protect his identity.

After a series of email releases on the @WhaleDump account, Cameron Slater tried to take out a court injunction to prevent the media from reporting hacked information obtained from his ''Whale Oil'' blog. Media lawyer Julian Miles QC argued on behalf of the media outlets that the information was of huge public interest. High Court Judge John Fogarty agreed but granted an order stopping the hacker, who was an unnamed defendant, from publishing any more "WhaleDumps", although media were allowed to publish material they had already received.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/slater-no-show-case-against-apn-fairfax-mediaworks-vy-p-161985 |title=Slater loses bid to gag media |work =National Business Review |date= 5 September 2014}}</ref> In his judgement Justice Fogarty said that Slater's case against the hacker was overwhelming and that taking information from his computer was akin to entering someone's private property and taking their private papers. He wrote: "There is no doubt at all that (Slater) has a serious argument that the unknown hacker has committed a wrong or tort against him, to which the common law will grant such remedies as can be practicably imposed."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10477468/Cameron-Slaters-case-overwhelming |title=Cameron Slater's case 'overwhelming' |work=Stuff |date= 9 September 2014}}</ref>

On 4 September, the original @WhaleDump account was suspended by Twitter. Soon afterwards, the hacker Rawshark reopened a Twitter account with the username @Whaledump2. On 5 September, after the release of a number of other documents online, Rawshark announced that he would no longer be releasing any information, tweeting a number of messages:<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/whaledump-signs-ck-161980 | title=Whaledump signs off | work=The National Business Review | date=5 September 2014 | accessdate=6 September 2014 | author=Keall, Chris}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://twitter.com/whaledump2 | title=Whaledump2 | work=Twitter | accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref>

''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' commentator John Armstrong wrote: "Hager's allegations are many and varied. They are extremely serious." Armstrong points to the allegation of the involvement of National Party personnel in hacking into the Labour Party database as the most serious, and draws parallels with the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11308460 | title=John Armstong: Hager's claims light a fuse under the State of Key | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=14 August 2014 | accessdate =14 August 2014 | last=Armstrong |first=John}}</ref> [[David Cunliffe]], leader of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], also describes the events portrayed in the book as akin to Watergate.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bennett |first1=Adam |last2=Fisher |first2=David |title= Cunliffe: Dirty Politics allegations like Watergate |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11309420 |accessdate=16 August 2014 |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date=15 August 2014}}</ref>

The revelations in ''Dirty Politics'' have also been reported in international media. Under the headline "New Zealand's own House of Cards is collapsing", ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper said "New Zealanders are currently witnesses to an exposé of unprecedented proportions."<ref>Dirty politics: New Zealand's own House of Cards is collapsing, The Guardian 25 August 2014</ref> Also in ''The Guardian'', New Zealand journalist Toby Manhire wrote: "''Dirty Politics'' has blown the National party (election) strategy dramatically off course, propelling the campaign into uncharted territory. Its allegations have dominated news bulletins for the 10 days since its publication, as accusations of dirty tricks, smear campaigns and conspiracy sally in every direction." In addition to the calls for Judith Collins to resign, Manhire suggested that John Key's "sparkling reputation" may be "contaminated by association with Slater’s toxic style."<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/23/-sp-new-zealand-election-john-key-alleged-dirty-politics The whale that swallowed New Zealand's election campaign], The Guardian, 23 August 2014</ref>

Cameron Slater subsequently laid a complaint with the police about the illegal hacking of his emails, and made a separate complaint with the Privacy Commissioner over the release of the email by the Prime Minister.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10447124/Collins-SIS-claims-to-be-investigated-by-panels Collins, SIS claims to be investigated by panels], Stuff, 1 September</ref>

===Resignations===

==== Judith Collins ====
[[Judith Collins|Collins]] had been under pressure to resign earlier in the year over her involvement with Chinese officials at Oravida. Once ''Dirty Politics'' was published and Collins' alleged treatment of public servant Simon Pleasants came to light, there were renewed calls for her resignation. The [[New Zealand Public Service Association|Public Service Association]] said her actions breached an important constitutional principle<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/20146204/public-servants'-union-calls-for-judith-collins-to-resign Public servants' union calls for Judith Collins to resign] Radio New Zealand</ref> and "Minister Collins must take responsibility for her actions and resign." Labour Leader David Cunliffe said Mr Key should fire Ms Collins, "because she has acted in a way that is unbecoming and unfit" for a minister.<ref>[http://www.odt.co.nz/news/election-2014/313017/dirty-politics-row-calls-collins-resign Dirty Politics row: Calls for Collins to resign], Otago Daily Times 19 August 2014</ref> Deputy Prime Minister Bill English distanced himself from her behaviour by saying "it's not a style I like". John Key called her "unwise" but refused to take any action.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10400875/Judith-Collins-looking-isolated Judith Collins looking isolated], Stuff 20 August 2014</ref>

As the pressure on Collins mounted, she avoided the media entirely for a few days. Then on 23 August she fronted up but refused to answer questions about her friendship with Mr Slater. She declared she had no plans to resign and refused to acknowledge her behaviour was damaging the National Party in any way.<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/vote-2014-news/defiant-judith-collins-fronts-up-won-t-resign-6062890 Defiant Judith Collins fronts up, won't resign], TV3 23 August</ref> A week later right wing blogger, Cathy Odgers, apparently sent the damning email to John Key's office in which Slater said Collins was 'gunning' for Adam Feely. Fairfax Media journalist Matt Nippert, who was investigating the hacked emails, believes that Odgers thought Nippert was about to exposé the connection between Slater, Collins and Feely. He says Odgers panicked and "alerted the Beehive to what may have been coming."<ref>[http://tvnz.co.nz/vote-2014-news/blind-panic-led-judith-collins-resignation-journalist-6068499?autoStart=true 'Blind panic' led to Judith Collins' resignation – journalist], TV1 News 1 September 2014</ref> John Key called a press conference the next day, Saturday 30 August 2014, at which Collins resigned as a minister.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10443712/SSC-concerned-at-Collins-allegations | title=Collins sacking a good start, hacker | work=Stuff.co.nz | accessdate=31 August 2014 | last=Smith |first=Lawrence}}</ref>

In October, the Prime Minister announced that Collins would not be allowed to use the title 'Honourable' before her name unless she is cleared by the inquiry into her behaviour.  Collins was reported to be 'appalled' and 'seething' that she heard about this decision through the media rather than being told personally by Mr Key.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10615618/Judith-Collins-seething-at-snub Judith Collins seething at snub], Stuff, 14 October 2014</ref>

==== Jason Ede ====
Jason Ede was a central figure in ''Dirty Politics''. Hager said Ede drafted Official Information Act requests on Slater's behalf and was frequently in contact with the blogger about ways to discredit the Labour Party. After the book's release, Ede entirely avoided the media. Slater subsequently described him as "squeamish" and "gutless" for going to ground rather than talking to the media about their relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11329167 |title=Ede resigns from the National Party after Dirty Politics scandal |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=22 September 2014}}</ref>

Ede resigned from his position as a media researcher for the National Party the day before the election. Announcing his resignation after 11 years "loyal service to the National Party", John Key said:

{{cquote|[Jason Ede's] primary role really, started out as a media person for us... and part of his role was talking to bloggers...I think he took the revelations in the book... personally because some of the book was very much aimed at him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/nationals-dirt-digger-ede-resigns-2014092208 |title=National's 'dirt-digger' Ede resigns |work=TV3 |date=22 September 2014}}</ref>}}

Blogger David Farrar said he thought Ede had resigned voluntarily and not due to the book's publication. However, Hager said he was sceptical about the reasons behind Ede's departure:
{{cquote|Jason Ede disappeared during the last five-and-a-half weeks of the election campaign but it's pretty obvious that he was given a free holiday or something to get him out of the way, and then he was resigned out of a job rather than facing up to the issues ... I think there's a connection between being caught out so comprehensively and his sudden departure.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/255200/hager-sceptical-on-ede-resignation | title=Hager sceptical on Ede resignation | work=Radio New Zealand News | date=22 September 2014 | accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref>}}

=== Inspector General inquiry into the release of SIS information ===
On 1 September, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Cheryl Gwyn, announced she would conduct an "in-depth and robust inquiry" in response to claims that details of a briefing between the head of the SIS with former Labour leader Phil Goff were given to Cameron Slater. Gwyn promised a comprehensive investigation saying: "The scale of the inquiry is significant – it involves access to a variety of IT systems, documents, phone records and so forth. I then need to analyse that information, discard what is irrelevant, and then take into account the evidence from those summoned." She said the inquiry was in "recognition of public interest" that the SIS may have been used for political purposes.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10447124/Collins-SIS-claims-to-be-investigated-by-panels Collins, SIS claims to be investigated by panels], Stuff, 1 September 2014</ref>

The results on the inquiry were released on 25 November 2014 three months later. Ms Gwyn found that the SIS gave information to John Key's office from where his deputy chief of staff Phil de Joux passed it on to another John Key employee, Jason Ede. Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the information should be worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11364404 Dirty Politics: John Key 'in denial' over SIS report], New Zealand Herald, 26 November 2014</ref> Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/63523060/John-Key-ignores-the-obvious John Key ignores the obvious], Dominion Post, 25 November 2014</ref>

Ms Gwyn concluded that former SIS director Warren Tucker provided "incomplete, inaccurate and misleading information" to Cameron Slater and to Prime Minister John Key<ref name="Gwyn report harsh criticism">{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63505210/Dirty-politics-report-directs-harsh-criticism-at-SIS | title='Dirty politics' report directs harsh criticism at SIS | work=25 November 2014 | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=25 November 2014 |author1=Small, Vernon  |author2=Kirk, Stacey}}</ref> and failed to take adequate steps to maintain the agency's political neutrality.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11364057 Dirty Politics: John Key won't apologise to Goff], NZ Herald 25 November 2014</ref> In the process, Ms Gwyn said "the SIS had effectively delivered Mr Slater an exclusive story while denying other media the same information."<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11364052 Dirty Politics: SIS director's three apologies], NZ Herald, 25 November 2014</ref>

The report went on to say that Warren Tucker "having released inaccurate information that was predictably misinterpreted, the then director of the service had a responsibility to take positive steps to correct the interpretation", but failed to do so. Gwyn further said that "These errors resulted in misplaced criticism of the then-Leader of the Opposition, Hon Phil Goff MP". Ms Gwyn recommended that current SIS director, Rebecca Kittredge should apologize to Mr Goff on behalf of the SIS. After reading the report, Ms Kitteridge went a step further and apologised to the new Labour leader, Andrew Little, and Prime Minister John Key as well.<ref name="Gwyn report harsh criticism" />

In a blog post responding to the release of the inquiry's findings, Hager wrote that:
{{cquote|John Key claimed at the time of the [Goff–SIS] incident ... that his staff were not involved in tipping off ... Slater about the SIS information. Key made the same claim again when my book was published. The IG found [today] that Key’s staff had indeed been centrally involved in this abuse of government power.<ref name="Hager responds do inquiry">{{cite web | url=http://dirtypoliticsnz.com/2014/11/25/notable-sections-of-the-inspector-general-of-intelligence-and-securitys-25-november-2014-report-nicky-hager/ | title=Notable sections of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security's 25 November 2014 report – Nicky Hager | work=dirtypoliticsnz.com | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=25 November 2014 | author=Hager, Nicky}}</ref>}}

He finishes his blog post by noting that many of the other components of ''Dirty Politics'' have yet to be investigated fully:
{{cquote|The Goff-SIS briefing was only one of many stories in the book. The difference here is that the Inspector-General has strong investigative powers and was willing to continue her review despite resistance from the PM’s office. Other stories concerning Slater, Ede and PM’s office attack operations, and their influence on election, still await being addressed by official or parliamentary inquiries.<ref name="Hager responds do inquiry" />}}

=== Inquiry into Collins & SFO ===
There were also calls for a wide ranging inquiry into the National party's dealings with Cameron Slater. Labour's finance spokesman, David Parker, described the revelations in ''Dirty Politics'' as "just the tip of the iceberg" and [http://www.radionz.co.nz/assets/cms_uploads/000/000/058/David-Parker-complaint-to-police-commissioner-1sep14.pdf laid a formal complaint] with Police into allegations that Judith Collins perverted the course of justice.<ref name="interest.co.nz">[http://www.interest.co.nz/news/71749/labour-formally-lays-complaint-police-calling-urgent-inquiry-collins-allegations-winston- Labour formally lays complaint with Police calling for urgent Inquiry into Collins allegations], Interest.co.nz, 2 September 2014</ref> David Cunliffe said there should be a commission of inquiry into all National Ministers' dealings with Slater. Greens Party co-leader Metiria Turei said there should be a Royal Commission.<ref name="nzherald.co.nz">[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11316898 Collins resignation: Calls for a full commission of inquiry], NZ Herald 31 August 2014</ref> Winston Peters said a full Royal Commission of Inquiry would be a bottom line in any negotiations by New Zealand First in the formation of a government after the election.<ref name="interest.co.nz"/>

The Prime Minister agreed to an inquiry but limited its scope to only one issue – the allegations that Collins undermined the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Adam Feeley in 2011. He appointed former [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] judge Lester Chisholm to conduct the inquiry.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253847/pm-defends-narrow-focus-of-inquiry PM defends narrow focus of inquiry], RNZ 5 September</ref> David Cunliffe felt this was an inadequate response and said Labour should be consulted on the terms of reference for the inquiry: "There is a well embedded constitutional convention that requires the Prime Minister to consult with the leader of the opposition this close to an election on a matter this serious. I would expect to be consulted on the terms of reference." Key refused to consult Labour over the terms saying "We're not going on a witch hunt."<ref name="nzherald.co.nz"/>

On 25 November 2014, the inquiry released its findings that although there were two independent efforts to undermine former Serious Fraud Office chief Executive Adam Feeley, there was no evidence that Collins participated. However, Judge Chisholm had quite limited access to Slater's accomplices or to relevant information. He only interviewed two of the five people who were party to the email that led to Ms Collins' resignation – Cameron Slater and Carrick Graham. He didn't talk to Hanover boss Mark Hotchin or Hong Kong-based blogger Cathy Odgers. Chisholm also had no access to Ms Collins' Facebook communications which she deleted in 2013. He also did not have access to her parliamentary landline calls or to cell phone calls from Slater to her. Justice Chisholm noted that "The absence of telephone records for Mr Slater's calls is surprising given that both Ms Collins and Mr Slater confirmed that they phoned each other often." <ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&objectid=11364284 Judith Collins inquiry: Four unanswered questions], NZ Herald, 25 November 2014</ref>

Nevertheless, Collins felt vindicated and said:
{{cquote|"I actually feel that this chapter of having to deal with these allegations is now closed. And I feel very firmly that I acted appropriately and within my ministerial responsibilities, so I'm very pleased that the inquiry has been so full ... and I feel pleased with the result."<ref name="Collins cleared">{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/63508530/Judith-Collins-cleared-of-involvement-in-SFO-smear-campaign | title=Judith Collins cleared of involvement in SFO smear campaign | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=25 November 2014 | author=Kirk, Stacey}}</ref>}}

In regards to Collins' relationship with Cameron Slater, she said he remained a "family friend", although she felt "incredibly let down" by him.<ref name="Collins cleared" />

===On opinion polls prior to the 2014 election===
Although it was difficult to gauge the New Zealand public's views on the contents of ''Dirty Politics'', [[Television New Zealand]]'s [[Vote Compass]] tool provided a rough indication. Based on over 13,000 responses up to 25 August 2014, Vote Compass suggests that 33% thought there was "none" or "little" truth to the claims in the book, 49% said there "some" or "a lot" of truth, and 18% didn't know. In terms of the effect of the book on voting intentions, 56% said it wouldn't have an effect, 15% said it would have a "little" effect, 11% "some", 10% "a lot", and 8% said they didn't know.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/vote-2014-news/compass-hager-book-impacts-voting-decisions-6063885 | title=Vote Compass: Hager book impacts voting decisions | work=TVNZ | date=25 August 2014 | accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> There is also some evidence to suggest that the number of people who believed the book's claims had grown over time.<ref name="belief growing">{{cite news | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/vote-2014-news/belief-in-dirty-politics-claims-growing-poll-6068795 | title=Belief in Dirty Politics claims growing – poll | work=Television New Zealand | date=1 September 2014 | accessdate=2 September 2014 | author=One News}}</ref>

A number of polls were held during the intense publicity surrounding ''Dirty Politics'' and showed the National Party losing support. Towards the end of August 2014, two weeks after the release of the book, National was still way ahead at 50.8%, but down 4.3% on previous figures. John Key also lost ground as preferred prime minister.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/polls/10436216/Support-slips-for-National-and-John-Key Support slips for National and John Key], Stuff 29 August 2014</ref> The Radio New Zealand Poll of Polls (an arithmetical average of the four most recent major polls) showed National had slid below 50% to 49.1% as at 29 August.<ref>[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/election-2014/columns/253305/poll-of-polls-with-colin-james POLL of POLLS], RNZ, 29 August 2014</ref>

The Prime Minister frequently tried to deflect media interest from ''Dirty Politics'' arguing that most people were more interested in other election issues.<ref name="belief growing"/> Once Judith Collins resigned, three polls including the ''Herald'' DigiPoll survey, all showed National support had gone back up to 50% while Labour continued to drop. At his first campaign appearance in the [[Epsom (New Zealand electorate)|Epsom electorate]] on 6 September, Key said the polls were showing the public had moved on.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11320138 Labour 'distracted' by dirty politics – Key], NZ Herald 6 September 2014</ref> ''New Zealand Herald'' columnist John Armstrong noted that Collins was pushed into resigning and said: "When Key sacked Judith Collins, the headlines screamed 'National in chaos'.

John Key's National Party was re-elected to government after it received 47.04% of the party vote in the [[2014 New Zealand general election|September 2014 general election]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2014/partystatus.html | title=Official Count Results – Overall Status | work=electionresults.govt.nz | accessdate=7 October 2014 | author=New Zealand Electoral Commission}}</ref> Judith Collins retained her seat in [[Papakura (New Zealand electorate)|Papakura]], but her winning margin over the Labour candidate was cut by half – from 9890 in the 2011 election<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11329003 Election 2014: Judith Collins back with less support], ''New Zealand Herald'', 22 September 2014</ref> to 5,119 in 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2014/electorate-40.html | title=Official Count Results – Papakura | publisher=New Zealand Electoral Commission | work=electionresults.govt.nz | accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> After the election, Collins was not reinstated to a ministerial position, and was relegated to the backbenches.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10595483/Priorities-for-third-term-revealed | title=Priorities for third term revealed | work=Stuff | date=9 October 2014 | accessdate=9 October 2014 | author=Watkins, Tracy}}</ref>

Political journalist Andrea Vance commented that "Dirty Politics didn't hurt National – in fact, all the evidence points to a lift. But it did harm Labour."<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/10525673/Vance-An-election-victory-for-nasty-politics Vance: An election victory for nasty politics], Dominion Post 21 September 2014</ref> Labour leader David Cunliffe commented that the focus on ''Dirty Politics'' and spying on New Zealanders had actually hurt the left: "You would think the impact would be on the Government party responsible, but the reality is that if one is not able to get the airtime because others are dominating it, that impacts the opposition as well".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11328645 | title=Election 2014: Cunliffe defends decision to stay on | work=New Zealand Herald | date=21 September 2014 | accessdate=21 September 2014 | author=Bennett, Adam Patrice Dougan, Cherie Howie}}</ref> Cameron Slater blogged that ''Dirty Politics'' had no impact on the election "because New Zealanders simply don't care".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11328974 Election 2014: Dirty Politics author gives his verdict], NZ Herald 22 September 2014</ref>

=== On John Key's integrity ===
Throughout the weeks that the allegations of ''Dirty Politics'' swirled in the media, Prime Minister John Key tried to swat them away claiming Nicky Hager was little more than "a screaming left-wing conspiracy theorist".<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/politics/nicky-hager-book-shows-nationals-dirty-politics-2014081317 Nicky Hager book shows National's 'dirty politics'], ''TV3 News'', 13 August 2014</ref> After National won the 2014 election, Key continued with this dismissive approach once MPs returned to Parliament. When asked by Green party leader, [[Russel Norman]], how many times he had spoken to or texted Cameron Slater, Key replied "Never in my capacity as Prime Minister". An editorial in the ''New Zealand Herald'' said this "revealed a cavalier disregard for the accountability and integrity of his office."<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11347326 Editorial: Speaker gives PM, ministers a licence to duck for cover], NZ Herald 24 October 2014</ref> After Key denied Judith Collins the right to be called the 'Honourable', despite other Cabinet members resigning in disgrace and keeping the title, even Cameron Slater thought this reflected badly on Mr Key. Describing Mr Key's decision as a 'silly mistake' he said: "Starting off the term with an arrogant and petulant act like that is unbecoming and foreshadows ill-will dogging him in this term."<ref>Slater, Cameron, [http://www.whaleoil.co.nz/2014/10/silly-mistake-key/ Silly Mistake by Key], ''WhaleOil Beef Hooked'', 15 October 2014</ref>

Key's integrity took another hit after release of the report by Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Cheryl Gwyn into the release of information by SIS director, Warren Tucker. Despite the revelations in Gwyn's report, Key claimed no one in his office had done anything wrong and refused to apologise to Mr Goff.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11364057 Dirty Politics: John Key won't apologise to Goff], ''New Zealand Herald'', 25 November 2014</ref> ''New Zealand Herald'' columnist John Armstrong described the report as "hugely embarrassing" and said: "The Key administration has plumbed new depths of arrogance and contempt for the notion of politicians being accountable for their actions".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11364204 John Armstrong: National's response not good enough], ''New Zealand Herald'', 25 November 2014</ref> Fairfax political journalist Andrea Vance wrote in response to the inquiries' findings that Key takes "hands-off to a disturbing extreme". She further wrote: "It stretches credibility to suggest Key – and his chief of staff Wayne Eagleson – bear no responsibility for the conduct of de Joux and Ede."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/63523163/Dirty-Politics-Keeping-Keys-hands-clean | title=Dirty Politics: Keeping Key's hands clean | work=Stuff.co.nz | date=25 November 2014 | accessdate=25 November 2014 | author=Vance, Andrea}}</ref>

A few days later, Mr Key had to admit in Parliament that he had been communicating with Cameron Slater by text about Gwyn's report prior to its release. Given that Slater is perceived, in John Armstrong's words, as "the second most-despised figure in New Zealand politics" (after [[Kim Dotcom]]), parliamentarians and media commentators were surprised that Key was still in touch with him. Armstrong said by acknowledging his links with Slater, Key "compromised his assurance that he had no knowledge of the dirty tricks operation".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11366095 John Armstrong: Outrageous behaviour leaves Key on the edge], ''New Zealand Herald'', 29 November 2014</ref> Bryce Edwards said that Key could not afford to cut ties with Slater "out of fear of what could happen if Slater became his enemy". Matthew Hooten said this could lead to John Key's 'downfall' as he "risks Cameron Slater going off the deep-end and revealing the full extent of his relationship with the Prime Minister himself, the Prime Minister's Office, with a number of John Key's ministers, with a fair bunch of the backbenchers, and with some senior party officials".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/opinion/news/article.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=11367008 Bryce Edwards: The downfall of John Key], ''New Zealand Herald'', 1 December 2014</ref>

=== On democracy & perceptions of corruption ===
In his column in the ''New Zealand Herald'', Dr Bryce Edwards, lecturer in political studies at Otago University, expressed concern about the impact of ''Dirty Politics'' on the public's confidence in public institutions and the integrity of governance. He said the official reports in response to the inquiries generated by the book should serve as a "wake-up call" about the health of New Zealand democratic process.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11365448 Bryce Edwards: The democratic deficit of Dirty Politics], New Zealand Herald, 27 November 2014</ref>  In the ''National Business Review'', Rob Hosking, supports this view writing: "The plain fact is, the country's security service got caught up in the political games of election 2011. Willfully or accidentally, it became a political arm of the party in power and not, as it should be, a neutral government agency." <ref>[http://www.nbr.co.nz/subscribe/165851 Gwyn report: shocking naivety or toadying by SIS officials?] Impact National Business review</ref>

In his column, Vernon Small warns that [[spindoctor]]s are acquiring too much political sway and see their main job as being to protect the Government from the Opposition.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/comment/63576511/Putting-the-spin-on-neutrality Putting the spin on 'neutrality'], Dominion Post 27 November 2014</ref>

=== On science and public health ===
Obesity expert, Dr Boyd Swinburn, Professor of Population Nutrition and Global Health at the University of Auckland, says dirty politics and conflicts of interest in government appointments are having a detrimental impact on Public health. Swinburn said when [[Tony Ryall]] appointed former National MP [[Katherine Rich]] to the Health Promotion Agency (HPA) in 2012, he ignored an 'irreconcilable conflict of interest' – Rich is chief executive of the Food and Grocery Council, which lobbies for the alcohol, tobacco and grocery-food industries, whereas the primary responsibility of the HPA is to improve the health of New Zealanders.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/politics/63816549/Scientists-are-undermined-by-attack-campaigns-expert Scientists are 'undermined by attack campaigns' – expert], Dominion Post, 4 December 2014</ref>

Dr Swinburn also believes the views of scientists are being suppressed by attack campaigns driven by large commercial interests in New Zealand. He points to Tony Ryall's dismissal of a letter from more than 30 senior public-health experts calling for an investigation of Rich's role on the HPA board.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/10465647/Former-MP-under-fire Former MP under fire], Dominion Post 5 September 2014</ref>

===Police investigation into the identity of the hacker===

==== Raid on Hager's home ====
In October 2014, five police officers went to Nicky Hager's home with a search warrant and spent ten hours looking for information. The alleged purpose of the search was to try to find out the identity of the hacker Rawshark, who hacked into Cameron Slater's computer to obtain the emails and other material on which ''Dirty Politics'' was based. They took away computers, hard-drives, phones, CDs, an iPod and a camera. Police told Hager he is a witness, rather than a suspect of the inquiry. Hager said: "It seems like a very strange level of resources just for a witness." [[Stuff.co.nz|Stuff]] noted that similar raids had not been made on National Party staffer, Jason Ede, who allegedly hacked into the Labour Party website.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/10585923/Hager-vows-to-protect-hackers-ID Hager vows to protect hacker's ID], Stuff.co.nz, 7 October 2014</ref>

====Successful legal challenge of raid====
In response to the police search, a legal defence fundraiser for Hager was set up on the website Give A Little by former [[Young Labour (New Zealand)|Young Labour]] leader Meg Bates, who described Hager as a "hero" who "exposed a twisted web of power and influence in New Zealand politics".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10592414/Cash-rolls-in-to-Hagers-legal-battle-fund | title=Cash rolls in to Hager's legal battle fund | work=Stuff | date=8 October 2014 | accessdate=9 October 2014 | author=Gullier, Aimee}}</ref> As at April 2016, over $65,000 had been donated to the fund,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.givealittle.co.nz/cause/NickyHager | title=Legal fund for Nicky Hager | publisher=Spark Foundation | work=Give A Little | accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> despite attempts to shut it down<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=3111 |title=Give A Little – Statement from Spark Foundation |access-date=18 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129051103/http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=3111 |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and criticism from Slater's sympathisers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/doing-over-the-witness/|title=Doing Over The Witness|author=Russell Brown|publisher=Public Address|work=Hard News|date=7 October 2014}}</ref>

Another legal defence fundraiser was set up by the [[Freedom of the Press Foundation]]. In an article publicising the fundraiser at ''[[The Intercept]]'' and detailing the police raid on Hager's house, [[Glenn Greenwald]] and [[Ryan Gallagher]] wrote that the raid could have been partially motivated by a desire to investigate whether Hager had received any information from the [[NSA leaks]]. As at 18 November, the Foundation fundraiser had raised over $21,000.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/10/16/nicky-hager-raid/ | title=New Zealand Cops Raided Home of Reporter Working on Snowden Documents | work=[[The Intercept]] | date=17 October 2014 | accessdate=17 October 2014 |author1=Greenwald, Glen  |author2=Ryan Gallagher}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://freedom.press/bundle/nicky-hager-legal-defense | title=Help Fund Independent Reporter Nicky Hager's Legal Defense | work=Freedom of the Press Foundation | accessdate=17 October 2014 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020130442/https://freedom.press/bundle/nicky-hager-legal-defense | archivedate=20 October 2014 }}</ref>

A legal team led by Julian Miles [[List of King's and Queen's Counsel in New Zealand|QC]], media lawyer Steven Price, and barrister Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a [[judicial review]] of the police action. Steven Price said "Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources". Commenting on the case, law professor [[Ursula Cheer]] said: "We've never really had a case like this before and we've never really had any of these (public interest) issues tested."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11347803 |title=Nick Hager gets high-powered legal help |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=24 October 2014}}</ref>

On 30 October 2014, it was reported that an updated edition of John Roughan's biography ''John Key: Portrait of a Prime Minister'' had a new chapter on the election which mentioned that John Key claimed to have been told the identity of the hacker Rawshark. He did not pass the name on to the author of the biography. Asked by reporters about the comment and whether he given the information to the police, a spokesperson for Key said that while he thought he knew the identity of the hacker, "he cannot be certain". The spokesperson also said that Key had no involvement in the police inquiry.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11350276 | title=John Key 'given Rawshark's name' | work=New Zealand Herald | date=30 October 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2014 | author=Armstrong, John}}</ref>

In December 2015, the High Court in Wellington declared the warrant used to search Hager's house "fundamentally unlawful". The judge criticised the police saying the way detectives went about obtaining the warrant was "not the type of facilitation that I consider the Search and Surveillance Act anticipates".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11562693|title=Police house raid on investigative journalist Nicky Hager found to be unlawful|first=David|last=Fisher|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=17 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/292444/hager-search-'classic-fishing-expedition' | title=Search was a classic fishing expedition, says Nicky Hager's lawyer | work=RNZ News | date=18 December 2015 | accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>

In March 2016, Hager travelled to the High Court in Auckland to collect belongings taken by police during the search in October 2014. His belongings were in a sealed container at the High Court awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge. Police also destroyed a hard drive which contained copies of Hager's data.<ref name="RNZ Rambo">{{cite news | url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/299317/no-more-'rambo'-raids-hager | title=No more 'Rambo' raids – Hager | work=RNZ News | date=18 March 2016 | accessdate=19 March 2016 | author=Baker Wilson, Kim}}</ref> Hager commented that:

{{cquote|I'm still gobsmacked that the police thought that it was reasonable to arrive like Rambo and spend 11 hours doing over my house where they found nothing they wanted.

It was completely and utterly over the top and it would've been depressing for everyone who works in this field if they'd got away with it.

I hope what this means is that people won't be more scared to be whistleblowers and more scared to be sources in the media.<ref name="RNZ Rambo" />}}

On 12 June 2018, Hager accepted an apology and compensation for "substantial damages" from the New Zealand Police for the 2014 raid on his home during the investigation into the hacking that led to the ''Dirty Politics'' book. The settlement also included the Police acknowledging that they had accessed Hager's personal banking data.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=David |title=Police pay Nicky Hager 'substantial damages' for unlawful search of his home in hunt for Dirty Politics hacker |url= https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12068928 |accessdate=11 June 2018 | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |date=12 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Henry |last2=Hunt |first2=Tom |title=Police apologise to Nicky Hager over Dirty Politics raid as part of settlement |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/104638742/police-apologise-to-nicky-hager-over-dirty-politics-raid-as-part-of-settlement |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=12 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Geiringer |first1=Felix |title=Police apologise to Nicky Hager |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1806/S00109/police-apologise-to-nicky-hager.htm |accessdate=11 June 2018 |publisher=[[Scoop (website)|Scoop]] |date=12 June 2018}}</ref>

=== On the media ===

After the police raid on Nicky Hager's house, the Labour Party's acting leader, [[David Parker (New Zealand politician)|David Parker]], pointed out that journalists have a right to protect their sources, and said there was a growing number of cases in which the police were being called in to investigate the media. He said the police had searched media offices after Mr Key's [[Tea tape scandal|"teapot tapes"]] conversation with [[John Banks (New Zealand politician)|John Banks]] and the [[Serious Fraud Office (New Zealand)|Serious Fraud Office]] had demanded the ''[[National Business Review]]'' hand over documents related to the collapse of [[South Canterbury Finance]]. Parker argued that the search of Nicky Hager's house amounted to intimidation<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11338454 Labour questions 'harrowing' Hager search], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 7 October 2014</ref> and said: "If the media are not free of undue intrusion by state agencies, or have too cosy a relationship with political parties; they cannot do what the fourth estate is meant to do."<ref>[http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/media-freedom-and-independence-under-threat-ck-112394 Media freedom and independence under threat], ''NBR'', 10 October 2014</ref> In an editorial, the ''New Zealand Herald'' agreed and said the police raid over such a minor crime was "not a good look for the police". The editorial went on to say: "The effect of such raids is to intimidate such people from approaching media to disclose uncomfortable truths."<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11340033 Editorial: Hager raid an intimidatory over-reaction], ''The New Zealand Herald'', 10 October 2010</ref>

In reviews of political events in 2014,  numerous commentators emphasised the impact of Dirty Politics. The New Zealand Herald's David Fisher named Nicky Hager as a finalist for New Zealander of the Year.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=11371521 New Zealander of the Year: Hager's election bombshell book led to three inquiries], New Zealand Herald, 10 December 2014</ref> Russell Brown said #dirtypolitics was "Word of the Year 2014".<ref>[http://publicaddress.net/hardnews/word-of-the-year-2014-dirtypolitics/ Word of the Year 2014: #dirtypolitics], Public Address 17 December 2014</ref> Martin Bradbury criticised John Key for his involvement with Cameron Slater but also took aim at the media for their part in dirty politics arguing that "many of these media outlets also worked hand in glove with National's black ops team."<ref>[http://www.waateanews.com/waateanews/x_story_id/ODU3OA==/Opinion/x_story/Why-proclaiming-Key-as-the-Politician-of-the-Year-is-ethically-bankrupt Why proclaiming Key as the Politician of the Year is ethically bankrupt], Waateanews.com, 18 December 2014</ref> Andrew Geddis challenged the Sunday Star Times for giving Judith Collins a bi-weekly column (once she resigned from cabinet), arguing the paper was essentially choosing money over 'ethical concerns'.<ref>[http://www.pundit.co.nz/content/suckerpunched-by-the-actor-formerly-known-as-crusher Suckerpunched by the actor formerly known as "Crusher"], Pundit 8 December 2014</ref> Reviewing these various commentaries, Bryce Edwards said: "There is a growing call for the so-called 'Dirty Politics cast' of politicians and activists to be shunned by the media."<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11376254 Bryce Edwards: A year of (neverending) Dirty Politics], New Zealand Herald, 18 December 2014</ref>
