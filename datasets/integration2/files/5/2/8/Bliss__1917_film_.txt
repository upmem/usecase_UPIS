==Plot==
Harold and Bebe meet each other by chance while out walking.  Equally smitten, they exchange calling cards.  Harold is a man of modest means while the well-to-do Bebe is "the most eligible girl in town."  Bebe is besieged by wealthy suitors but none of them measure up to her father's standards; he insists his future son-in-law be of noble blood.  Harold rents evening clothes from his laundry man before heading off to Bebe's house to woo her.  When he arrives, Bebe's father assumes Harold is another unsuitable beau and attempts to violently eject him from the house.  Bebe intervenes.  Harold happens to find a calling card in his suit pocket bearing the name "Count Rusva" on it, which convinces Bebe's father that Harold is prime husband material for his daughter. Wanting his daughter to marry Harold quickly, Bebe's father tricks the two of them into thinking each wants to elope. They quickly head to the nearest pastor and are wed.
