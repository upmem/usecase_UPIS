'''''Livemiles''''' (later known as ''Live Miles'') is the thirty-fourth major release and sixth live album by [[Tangerine Dream]]. It is the last album with Chris Franke. The first half of the album purports to be a recording of the June 8, 1986 concert in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], USA. The second half of the album is a remixed version of part of the August 1, 1987 concert in [[West Berlin]], Germany.<ref>{{cite vitn |title=Livemiles |url=livemiles}}</ref>

==Sources==
From its release, the venue and recording history behind Livemiles have been questioned. Careful analysis of the complete audience recording from the Albuquerque concert (including the soundchecks) reveals that none of the "Albuquerque Concert" on Livemiles originates from this show. Further, careful listening to other concert recordings from the 1986 American tour suggest that this material was likely recorded after the 1986 tour. Some of this material did feature in concerts played in 1988 after the departure of artist Chris Franke.
