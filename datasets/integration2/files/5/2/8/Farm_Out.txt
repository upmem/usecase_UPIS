'''''Farm Out''''' (stylized as '''''…farm out!'''''), is the second studio album by [[Swedes|Swedish]] [[dance]] group [[Rednex]] through [[Jive Records]]. It is the first and only album to feature the female lead singer Mia Löfgren, who replaced original singer Annika Ljungberg, when she departed from the group. Löfgren herself, again left the band after the albums' third single release, due disagreements with the producers, along with the other band members.

==Content==
The album contains 18 songs, three of them, which were the singles, "[[The Way I Mate]]", "[[The Spirit Of The Hawk]]" and "[[Hold Me For A While]]", that have been released out of the album. Unlike the first album, full of songs, ''Farm Out'' featured an intro "Fresh Pigs And More" and three interludes, titled "Boring…", "Animal in the Rain" and "Message From Our Sponsors". The song "McKenzie Brothers II (Continued…)", as the title reveals, is a continuation of the story, previously told in their song "McKenzie Brothers" from their debut album ''Sex & Violins''. "[[The Devil Went Down to Georgia]]" is a cover version of the eponymous 1979 song of the [[Charlie Daniels Band]]. While ''Sex & Violins'' has the same amount on dance/country, classic country songs and ballads, their second album "Farm Out" is full of their dance/country style songs only, except one ballad "Hold Me for a While" and one country song "Ranger Jack". The song "Bottleneck Bob", subtitled as 2000 version, appears for the first time on a Rednex album, which had been previously released in a remixed version, titled the "Run Like Hell Mix", as a B-Side on their single "[[Rolling Home (song)|Rolling Home]]". Although Ljungberg wasn't involved in the production of this album, her vocals are still featured on the "Message From Our Sponsors" interlude, which flashbacks Rednex's super hits including "Wish You Were Here", and on the album version of "Bottleneck Bob".

==Commercial performance==
Although in the same vein as their debut album, this album was not as successful as ''[[Sex & Violins]]''.
