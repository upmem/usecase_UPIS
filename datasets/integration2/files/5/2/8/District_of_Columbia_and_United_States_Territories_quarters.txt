The '''District of Columbia and United States Territories quarters''' were a series of [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarters]] minted by the [[United States Mint]] in 2009<ref name=mintmint>[http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/DCAndTerritories/index.cfm?action=progBackground U.S. Mint: District of Columbia and United States Territories Quarter Program] (Accessed 2009-01-09)</ref> to honor the [[District of Columbia]] and the unincorporated [[United States insular area]]s of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[American Samoa]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. The islands commonly grouped together as the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]] were not featured, as the law defined the word "territory" as being limited to the areas mentioned above.<ref name="caa">{{USStatute|110|161|121|2018|2007|12|26}}) – Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Division D, Title VI, §622, subsection 7. "Territory defined.--For purposes of this subsection,  the term `territory' means the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands."</ref> They followed the completion of the [[50 State Quarters]] Program. The coins used the same [[George Washington]] obverse as with the quarters of the previous 10 years. The reverse of the quarters featured a design selected by the Mint depicting the [[federal district]] and each [[U.S. territory|territory]]. Unlike on the 50 State quarters, the motto "[[E Pluribus Unum]]" preceded and was the same size as the mint date on the reverse.

==Legislation==
[[File:2009 quarters letter.jpg|thumb|A 2003 letter from Virginia Congressman [[Ed Schrock]] answering a constituent's query about the proposed program|alt=|left]]
Although the statehood program was, by [[legislation]], originally intended to include only the 50 states, legislation (District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act) was signed into law in late 2007 to include the remaining jurisdictions of the nation. A bill had been introduced five times in the [[United States Congress]] to extend the 50 State Quarters program an additional year to include the District of Columbia; the commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; and the [[United States territories|U.S. territories]] of Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. During the [[106th United States Congress|106th]], [[107th United States Congress|107th]], [[108th United States Congress|108th]], [[109th United States Congress|109th]], and [[110th United States Congress|110th]] Congresses, these bills had passed through the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and even had 34 Senate sponsors for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] bill during the [[108th United States Congress|108th]]; however, none of these bills were passed by the Senate.  {{USBill|109|HR|3885}}, the version in the 109th Congress, passed the House by voice vote in the early hours of December 9, 2006, just before it adjourned ''[[sine die]]''; but the Senate adjourned ''sine die'' shortly thereafter without considering the bill.   The 110th Congress version of the bill, {{USBill|110|HR|392}} was introduced on January 10, 2007 by the [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] (D-DC) and was passed by the House of Representatives on January 23, 2007.

On December 10, 2007, Puerto Rico-born Rep. [[José Enrique Serrano|José Serrano]], D-NY, attached H.R. 392's language to the Omnibus Spending Bill ({{USBill|110|HR|2764}}) that the House passed.<ref name="ganz">Ganz, David L. [http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ad=article&ArticleId=3547 Quarter Program Adds Territories], Numismaster.com. 2007-12-20. Accessed 2008-06-01.</ref>  The bill passed in the Senate on September 6; President George W. Bush signed the bill on December 26. The additional six coins to be minted in 2009 were expected to generate renewed interest in the series, generate over [[US dollar|$]]400 million in additional revenue to the Treasury, and lead many publishers to produce new products to accommodate the additional six coins.  H.R. 2764 also moved the "[[In God We Trust]]" from the edge to the obverse or reverse of the [[Presidential $1 Coin Program]].<ref name="ganz"/><ref>{{USStatute|110|161|121|2018|2007|12|26}}) – Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Division D, Title VI, §623, subsection A.</ref>

The 1997 act that authorized the statehood quarter program had originally provided that if the federal district, or any of the territories or commonwealths, became states before 2009, that new state would get a quarter.<ref>{{USStatute|105|124|111|2534|1997|12|01}}) – 50 States Commemorative Coin Program Act, §3, subsection 7. "If any additional State is admitted into the Union before the end of the 10-year period referred to in paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury may issue quarter dollar coins, in accordance with this subsection, with a design which is emblematic of such State during any 1 year of such 10-year period, in addition to the quarter dollar coins issued during such year in accordance with paragraph (3)(A)."</ref>

==Additional notes on individual designs==

===District of Columbia===
On February 1, 2008, [[Adrian Fenty|Adrian M. Fenty]], the [[Mayor of the District of Columbia]], established a committee whose purpose was to advise the Mayor on the development of a reverse side design concept for the 2009 District of Columbia  commemorative quarter dollar coin that would be representative of the District. The committee would solicit and collect public input on the design concept and would compile the input into two or three narratives describing concepts for the coin.  The committee would then submit the narratives to the United States Mint in accordance with the schedule that the Mint had prescribed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenty|first=Adrian M.|authorlink=Adrian Fenty|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602064253/http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx?agency=os&section=2&release=12825&year=2008&month=2&file=file.aspx%2frelease%2f12825%2fMayor%2520Order%2520Design%2520of%2520DC%2520Quarter%2520Dollar%2520Coin.pdf|archivedate=2010-02-06|url=http://newsroom.dc.gov/show.aspx?agency=os&section=2&release=12825&year=2008&month=2&file=file.aspx%2frelease%2f12825%2fMayor%2520Order%2520Design%2520of%2520DC%2520Quarter%2520Dollar%2520Coin.pdf|date=2008-02-01|title=Design of the District of Columbia Quarter Dollar Coin|work=Mayor's Order 2008-21|publisher=Newsroom, Government of the District of Columbia|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=MintDC>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/coins/coin-medal-programs/dc-and-us-territories/district-of-columbia|title=District of Columbia Quarter|work=Coin and Medal Programs: D.C. and U.S. Territories Quarters|publisher=[[United States Mint]]|date=2016-06-01|accessdate=2018-01-15}}{{cite web|url=https://www.usmint.gov/coins/coin-medal-programs/dc-and-us-territories/district-of-columbia|title=District of Columbia Quarter|work=Coin and Medal Programs: D.C. and U.S. Territories Quarters|publisher=[[United States Mint]]|date=2016-06-01|accessdate=2018-01-15}}</ref>
