The '''Balyan family''' ({{lang-hy|Պալեաններ}}; {{lang-tr|Balyan ailesi}} or ''Palyan ailesi'') was a prominent [[Ottoman Armenian]] family of court architects in the service of [[List of Sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultans]] and other members of the [[Ottoman dynasty]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. For five generations, they designed and constructed numerous major buildings in the [[Ottoman Empire]], including [[palace]]s, [[mansion]]s, [[konak (residence)|konak]]s, [[kiosk]]s, [[yalı|yali]]s, [[mosque]]s, [[church (building)|church]]es, and various public buildings, mostly in [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]]<!--It was called as such in English until 1930--> (present-day [[Istanbul]]). 

==Ancestors==

===Mason Bali===
'''Mason Bali''' ('''Mason Balen''', {{lang-tr|Meremmetçi Bali Kalfa}} or ''Meremmetçi Balen Kalfa''), a [[masonry]] [[artisan|craftsman]] from the Belen village of [[Karaman]] in central [[Anatolia]], was the founder of the dynasty. He moved to Istanbul, where he learned of an Armenian palace architect of Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] (1648&ndash;1687), whom he met and replaced as armenian himself. When Bali died in 1725, his son Magar took his place as architect at the sultan’s court.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Architect Magar===
'''Architect Magar''' ({{lang-tr|Mimar Magar}}) was charged with important projects and was consequently frequently promoted to higher ranks. However, as a result of a [[denunciation]], he was driven away from the court of Sultan [[Mahmud I]] (1730&ndash;1754) to exile in the eastern Anatolian town of [[Bayburt]]. There, Magar taught his elder son Krikor architecture before being pardoned and returning to Istanbul. Following his retirement, his son Krikor took over his position. Magar’s second son Senekerim collaborated with his brother Krikor. Magar died in Bayburt.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Members==

===Krikor Balyan===
'''Krikor Balyan''' ({{lang-hy|Գրիգոր Պալեան}}, also known as Krikor Amira Balyan; 1764–1831) was the first member of the family to use the surname Balyan. He was called Baliyan or Balyan after his grandfather and later adopted this as the family name Balyan.{{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed.|date=March 2018}} He was the son-in-law of Mason Minas and father-in-law of Ohannes Amira Severyan, both of whom were palace architects.{{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed.|date=March 2018}} Krikor received his credential of architecture from Sultan [[Abdul Hamid I]] (r. 1774–87). He became unofficial advisor to Sultan [[Selim III]] (r. 1789–1807), and was close to Sultan [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–1839). He was exiled in 1820 to [[Kayseri]] in central [[Anatolia]], because of his involvement in a dispute between [[Gregorian Church|Gregorian]] and [[Armenian Catholic Church|Catholic]] Armenians. He was pardoned and allowed to return to Istanbul shortly after a friend of his in the palace, Amira Bezjian.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Krikor died in 1831 after serving the empire during the reigns of four sultans, [[Abdul Hamid I]] (r. 1774–87), [[Selim III]] (r. 1789–1807), [[Mustafa IV]] (r. 1807–8)), and [[Mahmud II]] (r. 1808–39). His young and inexperienced son Garabet Amira succeeded him.

Krikor's major works include 
* Sarayburnu Palace (burned 1875)
* [[Beşiktaş]] Palace
* [[Çırağan Palace]] (burned by Janissaries)

* [[Topuzlu Dam]]

===Senekerim Balyan===
'''Senekerim Balyan''' ({{lang-hy|Սենեքերիմ Պալեան}}; 1768–1833) was the son of Architect Magar and the younger brother of Krikor Balyan. He worked together with his brother, but remained in the background.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He rebuilt the [[Beyazit Tower|Beyazit Fire Tower]], which had been constructed in wood in 1826 by his brother Krikor, but destroyed after a fire. He died in Jerusalem and was buried in the Armenian church yard.{{Specify|date=March 2010}}

Senekerim's works include the [[Beyazit Tower|Beyazıt Fire Tower]] (1828) and the Surp Asdvadzazdin Armenian Church in [[Ortaköy]]  (1824).

===Garabet Amira Balyan===
'''Garabet Amira Balyan''' ({{lang-hy|Կարապետ Պալեան}}; 1800–1866) was born in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. At his father's death, he was very young and not experienced enough to take over his father's position by himself. Thus he served alongside his [[uncle-in-law]] Mason Ohannes Serveryan. Garabet served during the reigns of [[Mahmud II]] (1808&ndash;1839),  [[Abdul Mecid I]] (1839&ndash;1861), and [[Ottoman Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz|Abdulaziz]] (1861&ndash;1876), and constructed numerous buildings in Istanbul. The best known of his works is [[Dolmabahçe Palace]], which he built in collaboration with his son Nigoğayos.<ref>''Continuity and Change in Nineteenth-Century Istanbul:Sultan Abdulaziz and the Beylerbeyi Palace'', Filiz Yenisehirlioglu, '''Islamic Art in the 19th Century: Tradition, Innovation, And Eclecticism''', ed. Doris Behrens-Abouseif, Stephen Vernoit, (Brill, 2006), 65.</ref> Another notable architectural work of his is [[Beylerbeyi Palace]], which was built in cooperation with his other son Sarkis.

Garabet Balyan was also active in the Armenian community's educational and administrative matters and carried out research work on Armenian architecture.  His four sons, Nigoğayos, Sarkis, Hagop, and Simon, succeeded him after he died of a heart attack in 1866 while conversing with friends.<ref name=garabet>[http://www.turkishculture.org/architecture/architects/balian-family/garabed-amira-876.htm] Turkis Cultural Foundation, Garabed Amira Balyan</ref>

'''Nigoğayos Balyan''' ({{lang-hy|Նիկողայոս Պալեան}}; also known as Nigoğos Balyan; 1826–1858) was the first son of Garabet Armira Balyan. In 1843, he was sent to Paris together with his brother Sarkis to study architecture at the [[Collège Sainte-Barbe de Paris]]. Due to an illness, however, he and his brother had to return to Istanbul in 1845. Working alongside his father Garabet, Nigoğayos gained experience. He was appointed arts advisor to Sultan [[Abdulmecid I]] (1839&ndash;1861). He founded also a school for domestic architects in order to teach Western architecture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Nigoğayos worked together with his father on the building of [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] (1842&ndash;1856). He participated in the preparations for the [[Armenian National Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nalbandian|first1=Louise|title=The Armenian revolutionary movement; the development of Armenian political parties through the nineteenth century.|date=1963|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520009142|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb__dIsS3aidr0C/page/n58 47]|edition=3. pr|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb__dIsS3aidr0C}}</ref> Nigoğayos died in Istanbul in 1858 of [[typhoid fever]] at the age of 32.

Known as a fast worker, his professional life was interrupted by the death of brother Hagop in 1875 and by [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]]'s accession to the throne (1876&ndash;1909). Due to political accusations, he was forced into exile in Europe for 15 years, but eventually returned to Turkey through the intercession of [[Hagop Kazazian Pasha]] on his behalf.<ref name="pamukciyan">{{cite book|last=Pamukciyan | first=Kevork |authorlink=Kevork Pamukciyan |title=Ermeni Kaynaklarından Tarihe Katkılar IV - Biyografileriyle Ermeniler |publisher=Aras Yayıncılık |location=Istanbul |year=2003 |id={{Listed Invalid ISBN|975-7265-54-5}} |page=97}}</ref>

His most important work is the Valide Sultan Kiosk. Interested in all branches of the fine arts, Sarkis supported Armenian writers, musicians, and particularly theater actors.
