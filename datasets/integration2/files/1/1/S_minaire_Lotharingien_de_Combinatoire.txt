The '''Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire''' (Lotharingian Seminar of Combinatorics) is a peer-reviewed academic journal specialising in combinatorial mathematics, named after [[Lotharingia]].

It has existed since 1980 as a regular joint seminar in Combinatorics for the Universities of [[University of Bayreuth|Bayreuth]], [[University of Erlangen–Nuremberg|Erlangen]] and [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]. In 1994, it was decided to create a journal under the same name. The regular meetings continue to this day.
