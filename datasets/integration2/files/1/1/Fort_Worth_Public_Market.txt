'''Fort Worth Public Market''' is a historic [[farmers' market]] and retail building located in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The building was designed by B. Gaylord  Noftsger, a native of [[Oklahoma City]]. Developer John J. Harden, also from Oklahoma, spent $150,000 on the building, which opened to the public on June 20, 1930. The building is noted for its [[terracotta]] tile and multi-colored tile roof. The main tower is decorated with terracotta [[column]]s and [[pilaster]]s.  The building housed various businesses such as grocers, bakers and butchers. At its peak, the Public Market had space for 145 farmer and vendor stalls and 30 permanent retail shops.

The building was purchased in 1944 by R.C. Bowen of Bowen Properties; in 2010 a fire destroyed a shed behind the main building. In 2012 the building was purchased by oil and gas mogul Bob Simpson, who sold the building to MC Estates in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.star-telegram.com/news/business/article3863587.html|title=Simpson Sells Fort Worth Public Market Building|last=Baker|first=Sandra|date=2014-06-30|website=Fort Worth Star-Telegram|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fortworthbusiness.com/news/simpson-sells-historic-public-market-building/article_b2e5b492-a917-5495-a041-9ee79a5864bb.html|title=Simpson Sells Historic Public Market Building|last=Francis|first=Robert|date=2014-06-30|website=Fort Worth Business Press|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>  It was named a Texas Historical Landmark in 1980 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 5, 1984.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcdfw.com/the-scene/real-estate/Shells-of-Our-City-Fort-Worth-Public-Market-148310015.html|title=Shells of Our City: Fort Worth Public Market|last=Wilcox|first=Theresa|date=2012-04-25|website=NBC Dallas-Fort Worth|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>
