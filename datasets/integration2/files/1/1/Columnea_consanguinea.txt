'''''Columnea consanguinea''''' is a [[species]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the genus ''[[Columnea]]''. They are [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]]. They are distinctive for possessing red translucent heart-shaped markings on their leaves that serve to attract their main [[pollinator]]s - the [[hummingbird]] ''[[Heliodoxa jacula]]'' - to their more inconspicuous [[flower]]s.

The species was first described by [[Johannes von Hanstein]] in 1865. It is classified under the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Gesneriaceae]].

==Description==
''Columnea consanguinea'' is a [[shrub]]-like [[herb]] with unbranched pale brown and hairy stems that grow to a maximum length of around {{convert|1|to|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. Their leaves are borne on [[Petiole (botany)|stalks]] around {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and arranged in an [[Phyllotaxis|opposite pattern]] along the stems. However, one leaf in each pair is a great deal smaller than the other leaf, giving the impression that the leaves are arranged alternately.<ref name="COSTARICA"/>

The larger leaf blades are lanceolate with unequal sides. They are about {{convert|12|to|16|cm|in}} long and {{convert|3|to|6|cm|abbr=on}} wide. They are smooth on the upper surface and slightly hairy on the lower surface. They are predominantly dark green in color but bear characteristic translucent bright red heart-shaped markings on the underside of their leaves. The markings are visible on the upper surface as yellow-green areas. The smaller leaves in the pairs are only {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and about {{convert|0.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width. They are located flush to the stems and look like small sheaths.<ref name="COSTARICA">{{cite book|author1=Margaret B. Gargiullo |author2=Barbara L. Magnuson |author3=Larry D.

The small tubular flowers arise from the stem near the bases of the leaves. They are about {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The petals are pale yellow in color while the [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] can be green to red. They bloom all throughout the year and develop into small numerous yellow fruits.<ref name="COSTARICA"/>

''Columnea consanguinea'' closely resemble ''[[Columnea florida]]''. The latter also has red heart-shaped markings on their leaves but can be distinguished by the teeth-like (pectinate) edges of their flower calyces.<ref name="MORTON"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Columnea consanguinea'' grow in tropical [[rainforest]]s at altitudes of {{convert|300|to|1900|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]]. They can be found either growing on the ground (terrestrial) or on the trunks of trees ([[epiphytic]]).<ref name="COSTARICA"/> They are [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ecuador]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Panama]].<ref name="TROPICOS">{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicos.org/NamePage.aspx?nameid=14000500&projectid=3|title=''Columnea consanguinea'' Hanst.|author=Laurence Skog|date=April 20, 2009|publisher=Tropicos.org, Missouri Botanical Garden|accessdate=February 13, 2012|author-link=Laurence Skog}}</ref><ref name="SI"/>

==Taxonomy and nomenclature==
''Columnea consanguinea'' was first described by the German botanist [[Johannes von Hanstein]] in 1865. Though Hanstein mistakenly assumed that the [[type specimen]]s were from the [[Philippines]],<ref name="HANSTEIN">{{cite journal|author=Johannes von Hanstein|year=1865|title=Die Gesneraceen des K.

The generic name ''[[Columnea]]'' was named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] after the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized spelling]] of the name of the 16th-century Italian botanist [[Fabio Colonna]] (Latin: ''Fabius Columnus'').<ref name="WEBER">{{cite web|url=http://www.genera-gesneriaceae.at/genera/columnea_sstr.htm|title=''Columnea'' s.str.

It is classified under the genus ''Columnea'' in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] Episcieae, subfamily Gesnerioideae, of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Gesneriaceae]].<ref name="TROPICOS"/> The German botanist [[Hans Wiehler]] reclassified it under a separate genus as ''Dalbergaria consanguinea'' in 1973. Wiehler's classification, however, has not gained acceptance among other specialists. Most notably, the American botanist [[Laurence Skog]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] prefers to treat them as belonging to the genus ''Columnea''.<ref name="WIEHLER">{{cite journal|author=Hans Wiehler |year=1973|title=One hundred transfers from Alloplectus and Columnea (Gesneriaceae)|journal=Phytologia |volume=27|issue=5|pages=309–329|url=http://biostor.org/reference/63611.text|author-link=Hans Wiehler|doi=10.5962/bhl.part.13920|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name="SKOG">{{cite web|url=http://www.gesneriads.ca/gencolum.htm|title=''Columnea''|author=Ron Myhr|publisher=The Gesneriad Reference Web|accessdate=February 13, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204114025/http://www.gesneriads.ca/gencolum.htm|archivedate=February 4, 2012}}</ref>
