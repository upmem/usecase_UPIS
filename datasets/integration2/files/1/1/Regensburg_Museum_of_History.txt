The '''Regensburg Museum of History''' (''Regensburg Historische Museum''), currently resides in a former [[Conventual Franciscans|Minorite]] monastery, is a museum of the history, art and culture of [[Regensburg]] and eastern [[Bavaria]] from the [[Stone Age]] to the present day. 

The former monastery of St Salvator, located in the city's Dachauplatz district, was founded in 1221 by the [[Bishop of Regensburg]] Konrad IV of Frontenhausen, Count Otto VIII of Bavaria, and King [[Henry (VII) of Germany|Henry VII]]. The three-naved [[basilica]] church was considered the largest church of the order in southern Germany until its closure in 1799. 

The church and most of its monastic buildings survived, with the monastic buildings converted as barracks and billets for the [[Bavarian Army]], and the church as a customs hall, a drill hall and a hotel until it became the location of the Regensburg Museum of History in 1931.
