Subject fails [[Wikipedia:NCOLLATH]].  Not notable as a player as he has not won a national award, holds no records and has not received significant news coverage as an individual.  NCOLLATH says that SOME assistant coaches are notable, using the language '''"well-known assistant coaches"''' - I would submit that Case is not well known as an assistant based on college basketball coverage.
