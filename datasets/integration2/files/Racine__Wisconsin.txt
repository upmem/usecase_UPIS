Racine is the headquarters of a number of industries, including [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case]] heavy equipment, [[S. C. Johnson & Son]] cleaning and chemical products, [[Dremel]] Corporation, [[Reliance Controls]] Corporation time controls and transfer switches, [[Twin Disc]], and [[Arthur B. Modine]] heat exchangers. The [[Mitchell & Lewis Company]], a wagonmaker in the 19th century, began making motorcycles and automobiles as [[Mitchell-Lewis Motor Company]] at the start of the 20th century. Racine is also home to [[InSinkErator]], manufacturers of the first garbage disposal.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/22/AR2007082200724.html | title=Grist for the Daily Grind | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] | author=Denise DiFulco | date=August 23, 2007 | accessdate=October 22, 2009}}</ref> Racine was also historically home to the [[Horlicks]] malt factory, where [[malted milk balls]] were first developed, and the Western Publishing factory where [[Little Golden Books]] were printed.

It has several immigrant communities, and is among the most diverse cities in Wisconsin.<ref>Mauk, Alyssa.

== History ==
Native Americans inhabited the area of Racine for thousands of years. Artifacts that have survived include the burial mounds in what is now Mound Cemetery. Historians separate the natives living in the Root watershed at that time into Woodland people and Hopewell people. After European contact, the Miami and later the Potawatomi expanded into the area, taking part in the French fur trade.

In November 1674, while traveling from [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]] to the territory of the [[Illinois Confederation]], Father [[Jacques Marquette]] and his assistants, Jacques Largillier and Pierre Porteret, camped at the mouth of the Root River.<ref>[Racine: Growth and Change in a Wisconsin County]</ref> These were the first Europeans known to visit what is now Racine County. Further expeditions were made in the area by [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] in 1679 and by François Jolliet De Montigny and [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes]] in 1698. Nearly a century later, in 1791, a trading post would be established along [[Lake Michigan]] near where the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] empties into it.

[[File:Root River Racine 070107.jpg|thumb|left|The mouth of the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]], Racine, Wisconsin]]
Following the [[Blackhawk War]], the area surrounding Racine, which had previously been off-limits, was settled by [[Yankee]]s from upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]]. In 1834 Captain [[Gilbert Knapp]] [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|USRM]], who was from [[Chatham, Massachusetts]], founded the settlement of "Port Gilbert" at the place where the [[Root River (Wisconsin)|Root River]] empties into [[Lake Michigan]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tablet to Honor Racine's Founder at Knapp School |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/857397/gilbert_knapp_founder_of_racine/|newspaper=The Racine Journal-Times|date=February 13, 1936|page=4|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = August 14, 2014 }} {{Open access}}</ref> Knapp had first explored the area of the Root River valley in 1818, and returned with financial backing when the war ended. Within a year of Knapp's settlement hundreds of other settlers from [[New England]] and western [[New York (state)|New York]] had arrived and built log cabins in the area surrounding his own.  Some of the settlers were from the town of [[Derby, Connecticut]], and others came from the [[New England]] states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.<ref>Rosenberry, Lois Kimball Mathews. [https://books.google.com/books?id=B8YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR9 ''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865''],</ref>  The area was previously called "Kipi Kawi" and "Chippecotton" by the indigenous peoples, both names for the Root River. The name "Port Gilbert" was never really accepted, and in 1841 the community was incorporated as the village of Racine, after the [[French language|French]] word for "root". After Wisconsin was admitted to the Union in 1848, the new legislature voted in August to incorporate Racine as a city.

In 1852, [[Racine College]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] college, was founded; it closed in 1933.<ref>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/wmh/archives/search.aspx?area=browse&volume=35&articleID=19098 Wisconsinhistory.org]</ref> Its location and many of its buildings are preserved today by the [[Community of St. Mary]] as part of the DeKoven Center.

Also in 1852, [[Racine High School]], the first public high school in Wisconsin, opened. The high school operated until 1926, when it was torn down to make way for the new Racine County Courthouse. [[Washington Park High School]] was built to replace it.<ref>[http://www.vindustries.com/racinehistory/features/racine-high-school/ Racine History]</ref>

Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Racine was well known for its strong opposition to [[slavery]], with many slaves escaping to freedom via the [[Underground Railroad]] passing through the city. In 1854 [[Joshua Glover]], an escaped slave who had made a home in Racine, was arrested by [[United States Marshals Service|federal marshals]] and jailed in [[Milwaukee]]. One hundred men from Racine, and ultimately 5,000 Wisconsinites, rallied and broke into the jail to free him. He was helped to escape to [[Canada]]. Glover's rescue gave rise to many legal complications and a great deal of litigation. This eventually led to the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] declaring the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850]] unconstitutional, and later, the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]] refusing to recognize the authority of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].

=== Immigrant culture ===
Waves of immigrants, including [[Danes]], [[German people|Germans]], and [[Czech people|Czechs]], began to settle in Racine between the Civil War and the [[First World War]]. African Americans started arriving in large numbers during World War I, as they did in other [[Midwestern]] industrial towns, and [[Hispanics]] migrated to Racine from roughly 1925 onward.

[[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] and [[Congregationalist Church|Congregationalists]] from [[New England]] initially dominated Racine's religious life. Racine's Emmaus Lutheran Church, the oldest Danish Lutheran Church in North America, was founded on August 22, 1851. Originally a founding member of the Danish American Lutheran Church, it has subsequently been a member of the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (UDELCA), the [[American Lutheran Church]] (ALC), and, since 1988, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). There was also a large Catholic movement to the city, opening up churches for their own ethnicity, such as St. Stanislaus (Polish), St. Rose (Irish), Holy Name (German), St. Patrick (Irish), Sacred Heart (Italian), St. Joseph (German), St. Mary (German), Holy Trinity (Slovak), St. Casimir (Lithuanian), and others. As years passed, populations moved and St. Stanislaus, Holy Name, Holy Trinity, St. Rose, and St. Casimir merged in 1998, forming St. Richard. With new waves of people arriving, older parishes received a boost from the [[Hispanic]] community, which formed [[Cristo Rey Parish|Cristo Rey]], re-energizing St. Patrick's into the strong Catholic community of today.

Racine has the largest [[North America]]n settlement of Danes outside of [[Greenland]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The city has become known for its Danish pastries, particularly [[kringle]]. Several local bakeries have been featured on the [[Food Network]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_rd/episode/0,2857,FOOD_26716_45958,00.html |title=Road Tasted |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |work=FoodNetwork.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_fi/episode/0,1976,FOOD_9962_18881,00.html |title=Food Finds |accessdate=April 5, 2007 |work=FoodNetwork.com }}</ref> highlighting the pastry. In June 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] stopped at an [[O & H Danish Bakery]] before hosting a town hall meeting on the economy and jobs later that afternoon.<ref>Don Walker, [http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/97544334.html "Obama brakes for a bite at Racine kringle bakery"] ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', July 1, 2010.</ref>

=== Industry ===
Racine was a factory town almost from the beginning. The first industry in Racine County included the manufacture of fanning mills, machines that separate [[wheat]] grain from [[chaff]]. Racine also had its share of captains of industry, including [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case]] (heavy equipment), [[S. C. Johnson & Son]] (cleaning and chemical products), and Arthur B. Modine (Heat Exchangers). Racine's harbor was central to the shipping industry in Wisconsin in the late 19th century. Racine was also an early [[car manufacturing]] center. One of the world's first [[automobile]]s was built there in 1871 or 1872 by Dr. J. W. Cathcart,<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.2 & 153.</ref> as was the [[E. J. Pennington|Pennington]] Victoria [[tricycle]],<ref>It had no less than two 4.75 hp (3.5 kW) engines. Clymer, p.6.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Pennington |website=Grace's Guide to British Industrial History |title=Pennington |accessdate=April 4, 2016 }}</ref> the [[Mitchell Motor Car Company|Mitchell]],<ref>Before 1926. Clymer, p.36.</ref> and the Case.<ref>Also before 1926. Clymer, p.153.</ref>

In 1887, [[malted milk]] was invented in Racine by English immigrant [[William Horlick]], and [[Horlicks]] remains a global brand. The [[garbage disposal]] was invented in 1927 by [[architect]] John Hammes of Racine, who founded the company [[InSinkErator]], which still produces millions of garbage disposers every year in Racine.<ref>James R. Hagerty, ''Disposal Maker Gives China a Whirl'', The Wall Street Journal, March 27, 2014, p. B6.</ref> Racine is also the home of [[S.C. Johnson & Son]], whose [[Johnson Wax Headquarters|headquarters]] were designed in 1936 by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Wright also designed the [[Wingspread]] Conference Center and several homes and other buildings in Racine. The city is also home to the [[Dremel]] Corporation, Reliance Controls Corporation and  [[Twin Disc]].  [[Case New Holland]]’s Racine manufacturing facility, which builds two types of tractors (the New Holland T8 and the Case IH Magnum), offers public tours throughout the year.<ref>Lee Roberts, [http://journaltimes.com/lifestyles/leisure/be-a-tourist-in-racine-county/article_61c57fc2-6b1f-11e2-ac6e-0019bb2963f4.html ‘’Be a tourist in Racine County’’], Racine Journal Times, January 31, 2013.</ref>

=== Historic districts and buildings ===
[[File:MainStreetRacine.jpg|thumb|Main Street, looking north]]
Racine includes the [[Old Main Street Historic District (Racine, Wisconsin)|Old Main Street Historic District]]. Historic buildings in Racine include the [[Badger Building]], [[Racine Elks Club, Lodge No. 252]], [[St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church (Racine, Wisconsin)|St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church]], [[YMCA Building (Racine, Wisconsin)|YMCA Building]], [[Chauncey Hall House]], [[Eli R.

The city is also home to [[Regency Mall (Racine)|Regency Mall]].

[[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed and built the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]] building in Racine. The building was and still is considered a marvel of design innovation, despite its many practical annoyances such as rainwater leaks. Wright urged then-president Hib Johnson to build the structure outside of Racine, a city that Wright, a Wisconsin native, thought of as "backwater." Johnson refused to have the Johnson Wax Headquarters sited anywhere other than Racine. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

=== Crime rates ===
Racine employs [[Community policing|community-oriented policing]], the systematic use of partnerships and problem-solving techniques to address the immediate conditions that give rise to crime. The number of crimes committed in the city in 2013 dropped in several categories to the lowest point in decades. Racine saw a 38.3 percent drop in violent crime from 2009 to 2013, making it the 10th largest decrease in the country. Property crimes were at their lowest point since 1965, while the number of violent crimes was the lowest for any year on record.<ref>Aaron Knapp, [http://journaltimes.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/fewest-violent-crimes-on-record-in/article_84cee170-8d97-11e3-b18b-001a4bcf887a.html "Fewest violent crimes on record in 2013"], ''Racine Journal Times'', February 4, 2014.</ref><ref>The Journal Times Editorial Board, [http://journaltimes.com/news/opinion/editorial/friday-finishers-good-news-on-crime/article_d6180acc-8f7f-11e3-9e22-0019bb2963f4.html "Friday Finishers: Good news on crime"], ''Racine Journal Times'', February 7, 2014.</ref><ref>Heather Asiyanbi, [http://racinecountyeye.com/2014/02/04/city-robberies-property-crime-homicide-lowest-decades/ "City Robberies, Property Crime, Homicide Lowest in Decades"], ''Racine County Eye'', February 4, 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073008/http://racinecountyeye.com/2014/02/04/city-robberies-property-crime-homicide-lowest-decades/ |date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>
